So my issue is, my (19F) sister (23F) gave birth a few months ago to my darling nephew and at the time I wasn't living at home due to having work in a place where I wasn't able to travel easily. So she was on her maternity leave, and I was home only 1 day a week, but bonded heavily with my nephew, and I am his godmother now.

It comes to the end of her maternity leave period, and she asked me to look after him for the time being, because at this point I was unemployed and actively looking for a job, just in case university didn't work out for me. I agreed, as I love the kid but I mentioned wanting to be paid atleast something as I couldve worked in this period and essentially I'm being thrown in the deep end as I've never looked after a baby before and I barely had time to properly learn the ins and outs before I was alone with the baby.

When it came to the end of Jan, she asked me if it was okay to pay me end of Feb, as she's abit tight on money. I agreed, because I didn't want confrontation but I was abit miffed about it. What annoyed me was she always brags about how much her boyfriend (baby's father) makes and how she looks after her money and she generally wastes her money on nonsense. I looked after my nephew for only half of Feb as his dad was home to look after him. But, throughout this period if she was off work, she would hand the baby off to me constantly, and I had no life because it was like I was his mom, due to this extending to weekends me having to look after him, which we did not agree on (off days too).

Now, she owes me a month and a half payment, and only wants to pay me half now as she says she has lots to pay and all these excuses, like her boyfriend can't help as he does earn so much, and also wastes his money. I agreed at first because she said she'll give me half, and pay for my transport fees to work and back for the month, and also due to not wanting to start arguments about money and whatever. 

I've come to realise that it just makes more sense for her to give me all, or even majority of the money at once because then I'd have to constantly ask her for money to travel to work, where she can just give it and I won't have to constantly bother her, which could lead to her getting annoyed and saying she doesn't have which would thus leave me in a rut.

WIBTA for asking for the money, knowing she might not be able to afford it out of her pocket, even though these other expenses she speaks of can be paid by her boyfriend? I lost my favourite jacket around September/ October and I have been looking for it everywhere, even online. Anyways so I was hanging out with a friend and boom my long lost jacket. I said “oh hey it’s my jacket, I’ve been looking all over for this” and she said it was hers and she bought it off of some website “varage sale” three years ago.. but I’ve never even seen it.  I even said I would pay her for it and she still said no!! Would I be the asshole if I stole the jacket back even though she’ll know it’s me?(On mobile) My neighbor is a really sweet lady, a bit older (F late 60s) , 2 years ago she lost her husband, really bad ass guy I (f18) wish I got to know him longer. After her husband passed, about 9 months later she bought a poodle puppy. My neighbor has a very sharp personality if that makes sense, she finds it funny to call you out on things that are sensitive to you. Very blunt. 
So past year or so as this puppy has grown and stuff, he’s become a genuine menace, he still has accidents while running around the house, jumps on people & scratches / nips to the point of bleeding (he’s a standard male poodle, pretty big boye) If anyone tries to point out how untrained the dog is she gets angry and defensive on a dime so no one brings it up. 

So obviously I get uncomfortable when my parents invite her over, I don’t really like being called out for being fat or my issues with school before I got diagnosed & medication for my ADD.

The issue: 
As a last minute thing My parents & I are going away for the weekend to visit family & we needed to find a petsitter for our two dogs, an older golden doodle & a small rescue mutt
Our original friend couldn’t do it last minute so my parents asked the neighbor. So yesterday the neighbor came over to see the routine and what she needs to do, we had lawn service in our yard so my mom had to run and ask a question so she left me with the neighbor. I tried showing her around but she said my mom already showed her.So I’m just standing there awkwardly, trying to be polite and not go to my room when she says
 “You know, I think I’ll just take your dogs over to my house.” 
I kinda froze up a little “Oh well I don’t think that would be the best...? (Golden doodle) is 13 and her bones are really brittle, I don’t think she could handle (her dog) jumping. Plus (little mutt) takes a really long time getting used to other dogs, he might get aggressive and bark to the point (her dog) might nip him or this lil guy might try nipping him-“

Neighbor spins around & starts screaming at me. Not like a louder angry tone of voice but a full scream that was making my ears ring, and whipping her finger in my face. Saying that her dog is trained and would never bite anything (lol plz I have a scar on my leg that says otherwise) and that he’s at a dog park right now and isn’t causing any issue. I just sorta shrunk up in my shoulders, kept saying quietly “alright ok I’m sorry” over and over, till she finished her rant and I just went to my room. My mom comes back in, neighbor told my mom that “(I) pry don’t like her too much now”, mom asked me later what happened.

I don’t feel comfortable with leaving my dogs with her. I talked to my dad about it, both my parents kinda gave the whole thing a bit of a shrug but get where I’m coming from. I appreciate that she’s willing to help our dogs out & is friends w my parents, I’m just worried that I’ll ruin their friendshipI'm pretty sure I'm an asshole and was fine with admitting it to myself until a few friends and family members told me my husband was in the wrong, so now I'm just genuinely curious.

Every year, Husband (32m) takes a few vacations, one of which being an annual vacation with friends from high school. Every year he asks if I (32f) want to go and usually I say no because I can't get the time off from work and it’s not a problem. It's nice to have some alone time for a few days. The vacations are also, ***usually***, very active trips, like snowboarding, water skiing, or hiking, and are all within the US. Husband knows my dream vacation is one where I lie on a beach every day doing nothing, which I’ve never done.

The group started planning this year's trip and they're going to the Caribbean! They're going to an all-inclusive resort on some beautiful island where they plan on unwinding and, at most, snorkeling. No talks of activities - just the sort of vacation I have been dreaming about. Husband thought I'd be excited for him. Spoiler alert - I wasn't.

Here's where some back story comes in that may illustrate my assholiness. My husband and I have very different relationships with money. He has a very high paying job and I have a much lower paying job. I'm okay with it. I work enough that I can pay bills, while having enough time and energy to pursue a personal dream, but I know I’ll be working for the rest of my life. He's been saving to retire since he was 18, whereas I don't have a retirement account. He hates it. We've been to counseling about it.

ANYWAY -

The conversation goes a little like this:

H: "I don't get why you're so upset."

Me: "You're going on my dream vacation and I can't go because I can't get the time off."

H: "You've never mentioned \[specific name of island/resort\]."

Me: "You're right. All I've said is wanting to go to a beach where I can do nothing."

H: "You couldn't even afford to go if you could get the time off. I mean, could you?"

Me: "That's a little condescending."

H: "Well, you said you didn't care if you had to work for the rest of your life and we can't afford for both of us to go on this vacation. Do you not think I deserve this vacation?"

Que seething rage. He turned the conversation into a big "I told you so" opportunity. Insult, meet Injury. The conversation ended with me telling him I had a right to be upset about it and he called me a snotty little brat.

AITA?

EDIT: Wow! I was not expecting this. Thanks everyone for your honesty. I want to clear up a few things here.

1. I used the wrong word. A lot of you are saying that I choose to work as little as possible because I wrote "I work enough that I can blah, blah, blah". What I meant was that I EARN enough. I don't pick and choose when I work. I have a full time job where I am on my feet the entire time. And I also didn't *choose* to work a low paying job. We live where we live because my husband's company relocated us. Unfortunately, I'm not a nurse, nor can I work in a shipyard. My options are very limited here.
2. I didn't tell my husband he can't go on this trip. I won't tell him that. It's never been my place to tell him what to do and I won't start now. And for those who called me jealous - you are absolutely RIGHT. I am green.
3. Our finances - boy oh boy is this a fun thing to explain. Long story short, my husband grew up poor. Through his own personal therapy, he's discovered that he needs money to feel stable in his life (which sounds, like, "well yeah, of course", but he puts it over his family, friends, and even his own happiness). He's been in relationships before where people whom he loves have taken advantage of his money and has always been very protective over his earnings. So, we agreed to keep everything separate for his own comfort.
4. I wanted to write a little something about my husband's job and how it contributes to my feelings surrounding this entire situation. As I said before, I work full time, on my feet all day. My husband has spent the last two years complaining about how all he does is sit and watch Youtube videos when he's done with the fifteen minutes of work he's had to do all day. No matter what job I've held during our relationship (we've moved a few times for his job), I have always worked myself to the bone only to make a fraction of what he makes for watching people build huts out of mud and sticks. Is that his fault? No. Is it irritating? Absolutely. My husband's job provides him with a company car, so he has no car payment. He also has a company cell phone, so he has no cell phone payment. He doesn't pay for car insurance, his gas, or his meals. It's all paid for by the company. I think I'd be able to afford a lavish vacation if I didn't have all of those things to pay for. But I do. And I pay for these things myself.

I think that's all I wanted to add. Thanks!English its not my first language so i try my best :)

Ok a little background,we been married for 10 years and have a great relation and family, let me be straight MY WIFE IT'S HOT she does a lot of exercise and became a yoga instructor and the studio use instagram.

So she and the studio start to put some pictures in yoga pants, short tops etc, and here is when this guy (married, 3 kids etc ) star sending PM like you OMG YOU LOOK HOT, she answer "innocently " some thanks or whatever, so one day she told me and I tell her a dont like that kind of PM betwen them, she accepted and apologized but she didnt want to block him she will ignore him thats her proposition.

Fast fwd to yesterday she put a ASK ME SOMETHING tag on insta as part of her job and this ASSHOLE ask her ARE YOU SINGLE ?

She just decided to ignore him and to her favor she show me the PM.

AITA for asking her to just block him and stop this CRAP ???

&#x200B;

EDIT : I have no problem with the "sexy pics " since i know it's part of the job and he PM to her private Insta not the company, she use her insta to repost part of the company contentBit of back story: I work on a golf course and doing so use a lot of mowers, hedgers, brush cutters etc. these are all loud, petrol operated machines which over time are proven to cause hearing damage. 

While the course supplies ear protection (ear plugs), I bring my own, high quality ear muffs that are Bluetooth so I can listen to music while I work, that I keep in my locker. My coworker however, can’t use earplugs since he has a ear infection of some sort (i dont know what it is) and his ear will often drip blood and some sort of waxy puss. It is absolutely disgusting. 

So you can imagine my horror when I see him wearing MY earmuffs when I get to work late this morning. He did not ask to use them, he just took them out of my locker. When I went up and asked wtf he was doing wearing them, he said he wears them on my days off or when I called in sick. I went off at him saying how unhygienic that was and how he should have asked before taking and using my personal things. 

I was so annoyed that I took it to our supervisor. Thankfully he was on my side since it was something I bought with my own money and not something the course bought. My coworker was told that he needs to buy me a new pair of the earmuffs to replace the pair that he used. 

If he’d just used them then I don’t think he’d need to replace them, but since he regularly has blood and puss dripping out of his ears, I think it’s fair, especially since if he’s been using them a lot on my days off, there would almost certainly be crap from his ears in there. 

A few of the other workers are calling me an ass for making such an issue out of it, so AITA?My husband hates getting rid of things. Even if it's something we haven't touched or seen in over a year, he always prefers to keep an item "just in case" rather than let it go. Our apartment is small and I struggle with keeping it clean and organized. I'm just now crawling my way out of a year and a half long severe depressive episode and I still get completely overwhelmed by piles of things that have no home.    

At some point I realized we couldn't keep up with the rate at which we were accumulating stuff and that, when asked, my husband will always answer with "I was planning on using that, let's just keep it." So I just stopped asking him. I started keeping track of things that frustrated me daily because they had no place or took up space when we weren't even using them. After a while I started phasing those items out and quietly taking them to the basement storage with the intent of quietly donating them or throwing them away if my husband didn't notice them missing after 6+ months.  

One of the items was a set of spoons with drinking straw attachments we got for christmas. I hate them. The straw part is too skinny to clean out effectively and they're too long so they don't fit in the drawer organizer properly. He professes his affection for them every time I ask to donate them but he's only used them twice in the three years we've had them. So I brought them down to the basement storage.   

A couple of days ago our basement storage unit got broken into. Nothing but some canned goods were stolen, but while we were looking through our things to double check my husband discovered the damn straw spoons. He asked me how they ended up down there and I had to come clean about the donation box I'd been creating. He was pissed. Said I was behaving like a dictator for doing this behind his back and since they were his things too he should get a say in what happens to them. I agree to some extent-- I don't touch sentimental items or things he actually uses no matter how much they annoy me-- but I'm surprised that he feels this strongly over spoons.    

Now he wants to bring the damn spoons back upstairs (along with most of the other things in the donation box) and he wants an apology from me. I don't know if I'm in the wrong here. So what do you guys think? AITA?My best friend Julia and I have known each other for maybe 15 years. We are both in our mid twenties and we do everything together. We share an apartment, work at the same company, share clothes, she’s like my sister. 

Julia was a virgin until she met an Italian guy a few months ago. He’s definitely trouble and although she seems in love and happy I’ve noticed small things that are alarming. 

For example he tells her what he can and can’t wear. He tells her not to even think about looking at other guys. I’m not saying he does illegal stuff but I am saying his lifestyle and demeanour point to trouble. I’m not basing that off dislike or bias, it’s stuff I’ve pieced together. 

Julia is besotted. The last straw came when my mom texted Julia her new number. Obviously we are close as a whole family and so my mom wanted Julia to have her new number. 

I was in our apartment and he was lying in her lap. He immediately looked at her phone and said ‘give it to me’ when he say the unidentified number and she handed it over without a word. 

I said in front of both of them- ‘don’t order her around like that. Julia you know you don’t need to hand over your phone like that just cuz he asks’.

It came from a place of protectiveness. I love her. She’s my sister and I don’t want her to be pushed around. 

He kind of looked smug and didn’t say anything, and later Julia came to me and gave me a hug and a kiss and said she loves me but I need to stay out of their relationship. 

I feel conflicted. Am I the asshole for getting in their business?I work two jobs and in the last four months I have had a total of seven full days off, where I don't work either job. Most of these days off have been spent sleeping in, relaxing, and catching up on chores, not really doing anything. 

This weekend coming up my fiance and I were supposed to go a cool event. I had already gotten the weekend off from both jobs and I'm working crazy hours to help make up for the time I'm taking off when unfortunately the event got cancelled.

So now I have two full days off. I've been getting kinda bummed out lately since I don't feel like I have much of a life and was really excited to go something out of the ordinary. So instead of spending the next two days in vain I have been suggesting to my fiance that we go on a trip some place maybe a few hours out, get a hotel room and have fun. I found a place with old Spanish Castles and a distillery to tour that could take our day and maybe see my fiance's brother since he lives on the way to the place I was been suggesting.

My fiance has been very standoffish with any of my suggestions. He's saying he would rather pick up the overtime now that they're offering him this weekend since the event is cancelled. I have suggested going on my own but my fiance has qualms he hasn't fully shared with yet.

I don't think its fair that nearly every weekend he gets to go on his motorcycle and ride with random groups that he finds on a bike Meetup app or with his friends while I'm working and this one weekend I'm off, he doesn't want to do anything. But I know if his friends randomly invite him to hang out or go some place then he'll be gone with the wind.

I'm beginning to realize that if I wait and try to do something with my fiance that it's never going to happen. I live within four - five  hour of many beautiful springs and other places that I want to experience but when I try to suggest I keep getting shot down by my s/o and told not to get my hopes up. But I have my own vehicle (well, fianced with him) , I have my own credit card, and working the two jobs I have enough income coming in that allows us to save and live comfortably so I should be able to take some of that money (cash tips at the end of every night) to pay for these trips.

TLDR: Supposed to do something fun this weekend but it gets cancelled, try making other plans with SO but keep getting shot down, realizing now it's a pattern and want to escape it.Am I the asshole for being uncomfortable with a bunch of guys flirting with my girlfriend?

Obligatory on on mobile warning

Recently me (20M) and my girlfriend (19F) have been having issues in our relationship. She has had a bunch of guys flirting with her, she downloaded an app to make friends (not in any way a dating app) and a bunch of the people she met on the app flirt with her. There have also been some guys irl that she knows that flirt with her. 

She never reciprocates the flirting but she doesn’t do anything to stop it, this has been making me uncomfortable. While I trust her it annoys me that she would allow close to a dozen guys to try and flirt with her and not put her foot down. And in the past we have had some problems with a guy constantly sending her nudes and trying to convince her to cheat, yet she would still want to hang out with him. That brings us to last night. She met a guy at work that was flirting with her a few days ago, he tracked her down on Facebook and friended her. He did ask if she had a boyfriend, and she said she did. He said that he was glad he knew because he would stop making moves and flirting with her. The problem is that he hasn’t, he still walks into her work and says “hello gorgeous” and stuff like that. And last night he waited for her after work to give her a ride on his motorcycle. Today he came into her work 5 times, then he waited for her to be off work again to invite him to hang out with his buddies. She said no since it was late, so he walked her to her car and gave her a hug. 

I am very uncomfortable with this, it seems like he’s doing a bunch of boyfriend things. When I told my girlfriend about this she got very mad and told me that I was just being jealous and insecure, to her credit I am a very jealous and insecure person. But this along with all the guys flirting with her has made me very uncomfortable. I’ve asked her to set boundaries with her guy friends, just to ask them to be platonic and not to flirt. My girlfriend thinks I’m being a controlling asshole. I told her that if this guy keeps showing up at her work and waiting for her to get off everyday that it would make me very uncomfortable. She told me that I’m going to have to get over it. 

Am I the asshole for being uncomfortable with what’s going on and asking her to establish boundaries with her guy friends?I say pseudo-stepdaughter because I’m dating her dad and we will probably be married soon, but I don’t consider myself her actual stepmother until we are married. That doesn’t mean I’m not paying for her, taking care of her, loving her, etc. 

Anyway, she’s almost 6 years old. I’ve known her since she was 4. Up until recently we have always gotten along very well. She always hugs and kisses me goodnight, we all do stuff together as a family, she loves my dog and we have a very normal family life.

Lately she’s started talking to me in ways that I can only assume are either coming from her mother or television. She is respectful to her dad, but when it comes to me...

She has said:

Are you gonna get me chips with my pizza or what?

Hurry up, woman!

Seriously, you don’t know how to play (video game)! Get it together, kid!

You don’t know what you’re talking about.

You need to start picking up YOUR dog’s poop.

You don’t even like me.

My behavior towards her has not changed until the comments started piling up. I’m not angry with her but I’m starting to get frustrated. I still snuggle her and get her everything she needs but I’m feeling colder now because of how she’s talking to me.

I told her dad and he said he’d talk to her but he seemed a little put off. Am I being an asshole by asking him to treat me with some respect?

Tl;dr: Boyfriend’s daughter started talking to me very mean. I want her to be talked to but I feel like TA because I know she’s a kid.I (23F) just completed my degree and at the end of last month, my contract at my work place for a clerkship ended. I scheduled a couple of weeks off for myself before starting classes to prepare for my country's equivalent of the bar exam. In this down time I'm also applying for graduate positions and jobs in general. I also need to complete 225 hrs of placement, so I'll be doing some applications for those too.

I'm a fairly motivated person, pretty good at sticking to a schedule and getting what I need to get done. I do, however, live at home with my helicopter mother (this isn't going to change any time soon as we don't move out until marriage in my culture but I'm looking for jobs outside my state so I can move with an excuse). Ever since my contract expired, my mother has taken up looking through various sites and asking people about jobs. 

At first I thought this was well-intentioned, but it was really stressing me out because it's all my mother ever brings up, it's the first thing she talks to me about when I come back home (and it continues for the rest of the evening) and sometimes she calls/texts me during the day when she's at work. If we're ever spending time together, she'll bring up jobs and it makes me very anxious about my future. I spend a lot of time actively looking for jobs, noting their deadlines and tailoring my applications for them as is. So I told her I had the situation under control and that her looking up jobs for me is stressing me out. 

My mother accepts this and says she'll cut back on it. A week later, she goes back to her old pattern of bombarding me with job advertisements. At this point, I want to clarify a few things about my mother's behaviour that are REALLY stressful for me: 

1. I know beggars can't be choosers - I'm applying for all the graduate positions and jobs I can find in my field, not just what I'm specifically interested in. My mother has told me the things I am aiming for are completely pointless/not worth considering, are inappropriate for a woman and that it will be hard for me to get married unless I listen to her. 
2. She constantly brings up how she pictures me in a high paying corporate job (in compliance and/or risk). This is fine and I know it's coming from a place of my mother wanting me to live comfortably, but it's putting a lot of pressure on me to work in an area that wouldn't be my first choice. 

Every time she brings this up now, it turns into very long arguments with both of us getting frustrated with each other. We had one a few hours ago and I told her she needed to stop looking up jobs for me because I really can do it myself. 

AITA for telling my mother to stop looking at jobs for me entirely?I have this friend in school, we’ll call her Alyssa,  who was saying some very mean things about me behind my back to my other friend, who we’ll call Jane. Jane told me what Alyssa was saying, and apparently Alyssa had been talking badly about me for years and basically gaslighted Jane into thinking I was an awful person who was manipulative and played the victim. Jane hadn’t been talking to me much and I kind of had been wondering why. So when Jane told me, together her and I had a sit down meeting with the counselor at school and decided what to say to cut her off as a friend. And so we did it, as gently as possible. But Alyssa doesn’t have like any friends now, and she often tells the school counselor and other people that. So now I feel really guilty. I feel like most people have told me I did the right thing and I had to do what’s best for myself, but I feel so awful, so AITA?Now I am fully aware of how the title would make me seem like TA, but I really do need to explain.


So I have a friend (for this, their name is Clem). Clem and I have been friends since elementary school, and we're now both in college. 

When I am at home, my phone is always in my room. I find that I get very distracted when I always have my phone with me (not good for a college student with a lot of homework), so I tend to not have it with me unless I'm going somewhere.

My friend always has their phone and uses it constantly. This is their behavior, and not mine, and I understand and respect that, because there are always circumstances for behaviors.

I have told them repeatedly that I do not tend to have my phone with me when I am at home, so it may take a while to for me to respond to them, and to please be patient with me. But it seems to me as if that goes in one ear and out the other.

On multiple occasions I have gone to my room to retrieve my phone, only to see multiple texts berating me for not answering them (a lot of "I wish you would just answer me" and other things like that). I'm not confrontational, so I tend to just apologize and move on.

The last time I snapped at them (which was maybe a year ago, and it was more of once again trying to explain to them I don't always have my phone.) Clem said I was scaring them and "it wasn't like [me].” I once again apologized for my behavior, and they said that it was okay, and we moved on.

Flash forward to today. I get my phone out of my room, and once again, there was one of those “why wont you answer me?” texts. So, I sent back something along the lines of “it’s hard to respond to someone when you don’t have your phone.”

I feel like its my fault somehow, and I could absolutely be TA, but my friends agree that Clem is being a bit ridiculous, since I have explained multiple times that I’m not always near my phone, and one friend said that its prime behavior of a toxic relationship, but I just don’t know. I’m all sorts of confused and upset because I really do care for Clem, but I need to know if I’m TA or not so I can change my behavior. I also feel so childish, because I’m not one to lash back at people, since there’s likely a reason for behaving the way they do. So I don’t know. AITA?To make a long story short I had a four month relationship that ended in a very weird way and now I found out I’m pregnant.

The baby’s father and I ended things on somewhat bad terms and since then there has been no communication. He’s a bad communicator and so on and so forth.

I’m not opposed to keeping the baby if things were to miraculously work out between him and I but I can’t take care of it myself. The way things ended pretty much told me it wouldn’t work out and a child would not fix it.

So would I be the asshole if I didn’t even attempt to get in contact to tell him?

Edit: to the people who think I’m only thinking about keeping it to make the relationship work, that was bad wording on my part. I was thinking in the hypothetical sense about the miracle thing. I was thinking more along the lines of ‘he called me right now and said he’d fix things without knowing about the baby’ kind of miracle. Not the baby. Sorry for that, I’m overwhelmed by finding this out today so maybe I didn’t word it well.My GF started asking me about my exes, a topic, along with any other relationship-related topic, I treat with utmost honesty. So when she asked me about this loaded question, I wanted to be honest. I also thought she would actually handle the truth, as I thought she was smart enough not to ask such a loaded question without being in the right mental state to handle either answer. 

I was wrong. When she asked, I said; "Hmm, I don't know. Some of them might be conventionally more attractive at least". Now, that's the truth. I didn't know, because I hadn't thought of it. I don't think about my exes much, and I sure as hell don't think about how attractive they are, because it's not important. My GF is beautiful and I wouldn't change a thing with her. Some of my exes are also beautiful, and upon reflection over it after her question, I think some of them actually are more pretty than her. 

And you know what? WHATEVER. That's my opinion on the matter. Who the fuck cares who's more attractive. I don't. Appearance matters to me when picking a partner, no doubt about it, but it is far from the most important factor. For it to matter so much, is superficial. Now, I think it is a bit of that superficiality that led to my GF's reaction. But it's not just that. She has confidence issues and has been self-conscious about her body for a long time. Though I really thought she knew me well enough to understand every implication of my answer; how it doesn't really matter at all (to me), and how she is still perfect in my eyes, etc. 

Adding to her side of things is the fact that I've told her she's the most beautiful girl in the world, many times, during different scenarios. As I started explaining my standpoint this is the fact she brought up, saying she was hurt because I had apparently lied. Now, telling your girl she is the most beautiful person in the world is classic, traditional relationship goo. It's like saying "I could lie in this bed with you for an eternity". You couldn't. I mean, if you were both immortal in and unending world, you still couldn't. You wouldn't want to. Not for a lifetime either. It goes under the category of things one says when under the intoxication of love, things that are not meant to be taken at face-value and literary, rather enjoyed mindlessly. Also, who's pretty is subjective, and a part of that subjectivity is the element of time. There's a quote so obscure I can't find who said it, but it was some musician. He said something along the lines of: "Your favorite song is the one you're listening to in that very moment". I believe in that. And as such, without any change of appereance or relationship status, a person can look more attractive in point in time than another, due to the situation. 

So to conclude; she asked me a loaded question about whether she was more attractive than my exes, I answered honestly (as I've told her I always will with such topics) and she flipped out.Obligatory- This is my first post on reddit and I'm on mobile so format might be weird, I apologize. Now, to the story.

Some background, I'm a senior in high school and drive myself (17f) and my brother to school every morning. We drive by this girl I know who we'll call A. A used to ride the bus to school but one time, I offered her a ride to school because I drove by her waiting for her bus and I felt bad for her. Ever since then, A has been expecting me to drive by and pick her up for school. I didn't really have a problem with it at first, but A is starting to be late to go outside and I'll have to sit outside her house while she's getting ready. 

Additionally, one of A's friends, B, found out I gave A rides and also asked for rides and because I'm too polite to say no, I agreed. Keep in mind I dont know B AT ALL. I don't really like having people other than my close friends in my car and I'm debating whether or not to cut off the rides since the weather is getting nicer, so standing outside waiting for the bus isnt such a terrible thing. So reddit, WIBTA if I no longer give rides to these 2 girls rides? It's not like they wouldnt have any means of transportation, they can still take the school transportation.

EDIT- Both girls are at the same stop

EDIT 2- Thanks so much for all your comments! I've decided to stop giving them rides under the fact that its illegal for me to have more than 1 passenger in my car due to my restricted license. I've informed A who will tell B that tomorrow is the last day I'm giving them rides and A was very understanding!I recently was tasked to measure the radiation intake for some colours. I took the lead and made the aim, hypotheses, materials list and method. After the experiment we had to make a power point on the experiment.  we recorded the data on my friends sheet which he eminently left it in the class losing it (it was the last class of the day). Earlier today the other person in my team didn't know how to make a diagram so i made that as well and the graph going of of memory (its due tomorrow so no hope in having one of them do something of it getting to redo something I did). I'm debating on weather I should send an email to my teacher explaining everything. Ill check again tommarow please help me they are good friends of mine.So around 4th or 5th grade, I had an embarrassing picture of myself which wasn't really picked up until 8th grade. Since then, classmates were printing the embarrassing picture and showing me them. I didn't really care because it was all fun and games, and well, that picture was taken 4 years ago, and I look a lot better then before.

I'm in my freshman year right now and the picture wasn't really shown to me up until today, and someone printed the picture of me but edited so it looked a lot worse. She started showing people around her the picture,  and when she showed it to a friend of mine, she said it was "low key bullying me".

She showed me the picture and I took the picture and ripped it. She said why would I do that and how beautiful the picture was. I didn't respond and just went somewhere else far away from them. (It was study hall in the cafeteria.)

AITA for ripping someone's paper of an embarrassing photo of myself?I know the title looks horrible, but hear me out.

I have suffered with anxiety and depression for the better half of my life to to impossible standards placed upon me as a child. These standards were determined by my parents off of how well my sister was doing at that age. Because I couldn't meet those standards, it resulted in a lot of verbal abuse and emotional manipulation from my family on all sides.

I am now in my twenties and less than a year from finishing college. Because of the cost of tuition and rent, my parents decided to buy a house near a university that my sister was going to and said that the rest of their kids would go to that university to save on rent. That is where I currently live. My older sister and her fiance are also living here while they look for a new place to live now that they are out of college. Unfortunately, despite not living in the same house for over three years before I moved here, old habits never died.

I am constantly being verbally abused and torn apart on a regular basis because of my sister's belief that anything broken or wrong in the house since I moved is my fault. Mice in the basement, my fault (I rarely leave my room on the second floor). Dog mess on the floor? My fault, even if I'm not home. Mailbox falling off because of erosion on the stone of the house? Nope! Must be my fault! 

Recently she has been stepping up the blame game and shouting to a point where I go straight to my room when I get home and I don't leave until I have to (i.e. work, school, bathroom). I have lost several pounds because I feel like I can't even go downstairs and eat without being yelled at. I am to the point where I can't even look at her without feeling panicked. As soon as she moves out, I want nothing to do with her. I like her fiance, but if their a package deal I'm fine losing that connection. 

I have seriously thought about moving out, but I can't afford anywhere around here. Anyway, her wedding is in July and because she and I aren't very close she decided not to put me in the wedding party. That's fine with me, don't have to wear a dress. The issue is I don't know if I can be around her and pretend to be happy for that long without breaking down. My homophobic family is also going to be there and I would rather not have to pose for pictures with them. I know the question of when I'm going to get married will come up, my sister will find some way to blame an issue on me, and I might want to be hit by an incoming train by the end of the night.

Am I the asshole for not wanting to be near my family after all these years of abuse, even though its her "special day"?Not really sure how to go about this, so here goes.   
My wife is very close with her parents. They're currently on a cruise in the Carribean. And given that people can be a carrier and contagious with COVID-19 for a considerable amount of time before symptoms show, I want to ask my wife not to go see them for a month or so after they get back so that we don't potentially get infected. 
WIBTA if I asked her not to visit them or allow her parents over until we're 100% sure they're not carriers?BD (24) thinks I’m (20) ridiculous for asking him to just have the baby(5mon) for 30mins before he goes to work so I can rest, just for a little. Yes he works a 6:30-3 laboring job, I work a 7-5:30 customer service job (as well as babysit the days I have off) the days he has off. He makes me feel inferior about it, he needs less baby time because he works more than I do. 
I left the room tonight and am on the couch so he can try and get our son to sleep without my help so I can rest. He comes in and steals my blanket away, slamming the door and proceeds in trying to put our son down. I don’t deserve it supposedly and am a bitch, which hurts to be called. Usually I try to tell myself the things that are said at night aren’t true, but it’s been the second night calling me a bitch for wanting sleep without a baby.
I know it’s hard w a baby, I really do but the longer this goes on the more I resent him. I wish he would leave us sometimes (and tell him to do so when nights like this happen). I feel like we’d be better off and if I can’t rely on him then theres no use for him to be around just to think I can when I actually can’t. 
AITA?

EDIT: Since no one seems to understand, I babysit as a side gig. Which means I babysit other children, I am not talking about babysitting my own child?Ok, this one is a doozy at I don't know what to do. 

So, I'm in school and there is this friend group. We hang out with each other all the time and we are all cool with each other. 

Or we were.

This friend group know I am Asian and they make jokes about it all the time and I am cool with it. Now, this one kid was making light jokes, but it's been getting worse and worse.

It's gone from stuff, "Can you see?" To, "How did you survive Hiroshima and Nagasaki?"

And we were doing this thing for science class and he said, "Wow. If we analyze Ash you might see you ancestors?"

I shut up and ignores him the rest of the day. By the end he was some what annoyed and kept bugging me wanting to know if I was ok. I still didn't answer.

So, WIBTA if I didn't looked or talk to this dude ever again? 

Edit: The way he acts is a total douche in my opinion.

Edit 2: Any Grammer errors I though I made.I joined a new school last year and since then I've been friends with this guy called Rob. From the first moment i met him i instantly noticed one thing: his smell. He gets bullied by the class for it, and sometimes i feel bad but sometimes (real asshole moment) i don't. Some of my other classmates have told me that he has been like this since the beginning of the first year. I don't really know why he's like this, but i know that he doesn't have any problem at home or financial problems. He smells like a wet dog and it's very STRONG, and when i say strong i mean that you can literally smell it from the other side of the room, and also his hair is very greasy  or dry as with a shitload of dandruff (there's no in-between). His face is kinda the same. Sometimes he also has white spots on his face (dandruff or popped pimples) and wears the same 4-5 clothes. I feel angry when he complains to me about him being bullied because it would literally stop if he only cared more about his hygiene. I've tried in a non serious way to talk to him about this but he always says that he puts deodorant on and does showers. I don't want to offend him with harsh words, i just want it to stop because lately it has been seriously unbearable to sit next to him for more than 2 minutes and he always roams around me and I'm not a fan of the bullying.

[TL;DR] A friend of mine smells a lot to the point it's unbearable without a reason and also gets bullied for it and i want to tell him so that it can stopI'm an 17(F) and I go to a community college in Texas for starters- I'm enrolled in a class with the person who asked the question.

So the person is another 18/19(F), and we've talked sparsely few times since the class started. She commented offhandedly about being bisexual on the first day of class and being bi-curious myself (secretly; I have NOT come out yet to anyone in real life) I just kind of gave a small nod of approval . We talked about little else since then and have had no real interactions out of the 2 months we've been going to class together. The occasional joke is commented here and there, but not at all what I would consider friends or close.

Last class, however, I heard her whisper something relatively loud to her friend that sits next to her. That she has an incredibly good 'gaydar'. I didn't think it was in reference to me at first (but now I think it might've been??)

Today though, was when things drew to a head. The class door had not yet been unlocked, and myself, a few other classmates, and her were just making small talk before the door opened. The conversation eventually faded out between the other parties and turned to just between her and me. Nothing romantic, flirtatious, just strictly talking about the class.

Then out of the blue- She asks in front of everyone, "So...I'm getting gay vibes from you. Are you gay?"

I was really taken aback by the forward nature of the question and slightly offended at **how** she asked it? Since I live in an area where it's the kind of thing that could really get someone in trouble (very conservative part of Texas) it's not exactly something that is common here? I was also pretty embarrassed being put on the spot to answer a question (still in front of everyone else) since I'm not even 100% confident with the label I put on my orientation now.

I was extremely nervous and just kind of brushed off the question saying that "No I'm not gay" in a very frazzled manner. When the door opened I ran away and into the classroom (pretty certain my face was completely red). She looked kind of shocked that I ran away from her/the question, but didn't pester me more about it.

Looking back on it, I'm sure I could've handled it better, but I am curious to know if AITA in this situation? Maybe I could've been a bit nicer about explaining it, but again, I don't even know her.A little info about myself so you can understand my POV in the story. I am a little bit egoistic because a long time in my life I had to care for myself because I had no friends and my family was a little torn apart so nobody really took care of me. So I never really learned things like empathy early in life, but since I have friends, my boyfriend and a functioning family I know how to be there for someone else. Still I have phases when I care more about me than others. (Luckily it’s not that often anymore) Idk if that’s normal or me having a negative trait but it is a part of me that I am working on. I already told my boyfriend about it at the beginning of our relationship. He said he’ll understand. 

To the story: me and my Boyfriend were eating at a Restaurant today, he invited me even tho I wanted to pay for myself but he insisted because I lost my job recently and don’t have income! I didn‘t finish my meal because we already had a warm meal this noon. So I took the leftovers home to eat them when I have my evening or night cravings. We came home, walked the dog and watched some netflix. 

He told me he was hungry and asked if he could have my leftovers. I told him no, I want to eat it myself. He said he only wants to take the half. I told him again I want to eat it myself when I am hungry. He was a little pissed and told me, he thinks it was shitty behavior from me. I was a little sad that he said that but I understood him. Still I explained myself that I was excited to eat the leftovers for my evening cravings (I can’t sleep when I am hungry and I don’t eat much in one meal, so I have a lot of small meals a day) and it still was my food and I could decide what to do with it, and he already finished his food at the restaurant. 

He got even more pissed and said “I think it’s shitty from you anyway!” So I got pissed too because he won’t reason with me or understand my arguments. He told me that he paid for my food so he is entitled to have a little from it for himself and it isn’t fair that I won’t let him. I offered him to give him back the money he paid for my food. He answered “No I don’t want it, it is about the principal” Now he is acting offended and barely talks to me. 

This is the first time this happened in our 9 month relationship that he is sulking and I feel like he is over reacting because when he is hungry he can make some bread or the leftovers from what I cooked today! Or am I the bad guy? Was it stubborn to not give him my food? AITA? To be clear, this is a conflict between two of my high school friends. I’m asking on behalf of friend A, as she told the story, so technically I only have info from her side + my own POV:

Context: Friend A and B used to be good friends, however a lot of resentment and conflict had built up over the years, which has resulted in serious arguments here and there. From my observations, this is due to incompatible personalities: friend A is blunt and aggressive, whereas friend B is insecure and tries to undermine friend A’s self esteem. Conflicts usually go along the lines of these examples:

1. Friend A once asked for the other’s opinion on a photo she was posting, to which friend B exclaimed (from across the classroom): “Wow, I didn’t know you were so insecure!”
2. Friend A yelled at friend B when B joked about A's relationship rumors, to which friend B burst into tears in public, because she felt friend A was too accusatory/blaming.

Eventually this reached a climax point. Friend B had been talking to friend A’s guy friend, telling him to “go for it” and ask her out. When friend A found out, she was furious. She texted her, saying to never interrupt with her relationships again, to which friend B brushed off and said: “So do you want me to apologize or something? I don’t really mind I just want to drop this and move on.” B also stated: “What was I supposed to say to him? hey dude sorry she’s hella uninterested I guess ur just not good enough for her standards. idk”.

Friend A told her to stop making excuses, and ended with a blunt: “Just next time stop interfering w/ my stuff I don’t ask you to, and then attempt to fix it. I’m good I don’t need your ‘help’. “

Straight after this message, friend B blocks friend A, no explanation. They continue to maintain a professional relationship for a leadership project at school, but even others can sense the tension. AITA (Friend A) for being too blunt?A little background. My boyfriend works at a restaurant. One of his wealthier customers offered for us to fly down to his vacation house in Mexico for a week. He even offered to pay his airline ticket.

He was very excited about it but I was instantly suspicious. Neither of us knows this man personally beyond the fact that he has been serving him as a waiter for a few years. However, a few of his coworkers and friends apparently do and assured my boyfriend that he was a safe guy and we should go.

I still wasnt convinced, having never even met this man. And offering to even pay for his airfare just seemed too sketchy to me. My family has taken the same position as me.

We are both fairly young (college) and have only been together for about a year. I essentially told him I would not be going because I just didnt feel safe. He interpreted this as me not trusting him or his judgement of people in general, and that I'm putting my family's opinion above his.

I told him he was welcome to go with one of his buddies, but I just didn't feel safe. This has turned into a recurring argument and I feel horrible about it, but I also feel like I should be prioritizing my own safety.

In conclusion: am I the asshole?I (22f) am a cosplayer. I dress up for fun as anime characters and I've been doing that for five years now. I'm not a pro or anything, but I've learned how to sew, make foam armor, that sort of stuff, I'm sorta competent at it right now.

A local anime convention near my town was having a cosplay contest. All you had to do was have your pic taken during the event and sent before their deadline and people would vote on them on Facebook. It was sort of informal and the prize was only a few gift cards so it wasn't a big deal. I don't have much of an online presence so I didn't think I would have a chance, but I decided to give it a shot anyway since I've been building a certain armor for a while and I thought it looked good. Without getting into the details, it's a warrior that happens to have an ample cleavage window. (yeah, I know, but I still love her)

After voting had started, I was surprised at the positive feedback I was receiving. Some comments said I looked fierce, my wig was fantastic, my armor looked real, etc. A few of the comments also pointed out how I was "really doing the character justice" because of the size of my breasts, some more crudely worded than others. I left a like on all the replies since any praise was good. The only issue is: I'm flat as a board.

Underneath my armor, I was wearing what is quite literally a breastplate made out of silicon that gives me (in the words of a friend) some serious boobage. The armor had a neckpiece and shoulderpads, so the seams were perfectly hidden. Since the character's cleavage is sorta diamond-shaped, there's even underboob on display so it doesn't look like I'm just padding out a bra, it looks like the real deal.

A week goes by and I get a notification on facebook. Apparently I won the contest. I was ecstatic, it was the first time my "work" had been recognized like that. I messaged some friends, they were all happy for me. I was reading the comments and one of them stuck out, saying he wasn't surprised I had won considering my body. So I decided to be snarky and reply with "Well, if all that's needed to win a contest are boobs, here's where I bought mine!" and linked the silicon breasts I was using.

And apparently that was a mistake, since I got a few rude comments on that reply, some saying I was fooling people, some a bit more nasty saying I was just using a fake body just to get ahead of "real cosplayers". A few people even left mean comments on my facebook and instagram for that. I took a break from social media because they were being a pain in the ass.

I told friends about what happened and some of them said I might have been the asshole for being snarky like that and I should have just accepted the prize and moved on, but I feel like this situation has escalated way too far. It even soured my mood towards that specific cosplay even though it's probably my best work so far. AITA?

UPDATE: Thank you all very much for all the love, I wasn't expecting this to blow up like this but I'm glad to know I was snarky but a bit justified. Knowing there are more people out there who bust their ass in complex costumes does make me feel better about my boobage.  
SiliconE, not silicon, my bad on that. English isn't my first language.  
For those curious, my chestplate comes from Wirru aka Ameno Kitaro. He detailed the process of making Mai Shiranui's boobs on his Patreon and I just followed his tutorials since I wanted something custom for my skin tone and size. Look him up, his breasts look better than real ones, really. I should have written "got" instead of "bought" in the main post, sorry!I am a freshman (18F) in university, in the middle of winter quarter, and I'm taking three classes. 

So a couple months ago my family and I auditioned to be part of this reality TV show, and we got through. I told my mom to check with the producers to make sure the filming dates don't overlap with my finals, but she didn't tell them because she thought it would affect our chance of making it through auditions. 

Well apparently the film dates are on the same days as the finals for my two classes, and now my mom wants me to drop these classes (The professors of these classes absolutely forbid make-up finals). She doesn't understand that not taking these classes makes me a part-time student, and so not only would my financial aid be affected, I wouldn't be able to live in the residential halls next quarter. I would literally have no place to live. 

We argued over the phone and my mom said that I was being selfish, and that it's a once in a lifetime opportunity, but I've been busting my ass for these classes all quarter and when I told her that she goes, "Have you really?" which made me honestly feel pretty bad about myself. 

So, am I the asshole for prioritizing my education over a stupid game show?So I'm currently in 12th grade, about to graduate in June which is also when my prom is planned to take place. Here in Germany prom is a celebration only for the graduating students and their friends and families. Me and my classmates all have 4 tickets for friends and family and if we want more tickets we need to ask someone else if they'd give us their spare tickets. As my family is the definition of a patchwork family, I need like double the tickets for parents, step parents and siblings as well as my siblings significant others.
The tickets are all for the formal part of the prom, like dinner, first dances, speeches. To save tickets, I'm thinking about asking my stepbrother and his fiancée if they'd mind to come later when the prom is open to the public. I know he's never been someone who loves these formal things - he doesn't even like to wear a suit - and he also is someone who loves to stir up drama and take all the attention for himself which I don't appreciate since my prom is supposed to be my special day. 
My parents say that I have to invite him since he's my stepbrother and I know this might sound like a really shitty move, but I am just afraid that I can't get enough tickets for all of them. Almost everyone I've asked said they use all their tickets. 
So... WIBTA?so i support someone with autism and when they get upset they have a habit of flying off the rails and shouting every insult at me under the sun, some of which i won't say here

and basically today i lost my patience a bit

i told him i wouldn't speak to him until he apologised, that it's not okay to talk like that to anyone, that i don't deserve it when all i do is help him, and reminded him that i don't speak like that to him

does it make me the asshole for calling him out despite the fact that he has autism and learning disabilities?Throwaway because I don’t want this on my main account.

I’m a 33 year old woman living by myself in mid sized city. I jog every other night in a big loop around my neighborhood. A few months ago some people in my community started a volunteer soup kitchen/food pantry type place in an empty lot in a random corner of our town. My jogging trail takes me straight into this lot because I take a small forest trail that spits directly into this area.

My issue has been mostly with the crowd. The building is a series of makeshift containers with windows, not even real buildings. Homeless men from all over congregate. I don’t know if they have a real license for this but the city apparently turns a blind eye. But nearly every time I run through this lot, there will be 1-2 homeless men yelling at me, catcalling me, making feel like I’m in danger just for jogging. 

I’ve tried to complain to their organizers but they basically told me to run somewhere else, which isn’t realistic. I’ve asked them multiple times to vet their crowds a little bit better for other people’s safety but they’ve ignored me. I’ve tried everything to communicate my concerns but they simply said they can’t do anything to help me.

I then wrote letters to my local government and got back some generic message telling me they’re “looking into it” but nothing happened. Eventually I got fed up a few weeks ago and posted to this big women joggers group on fb. It blew up and apparently people were calling my city day in day out to complain. Eventually the city buckled and moved these people and those containers somewhere else. 

I thought that was it, but now I’m getting a lot of hate mail from people in my city calling me privileged and racist. Apparently they had a lot of undocumented families visit there in the daytime (which I had no idea of knowing since I run in the evenings) and after relocating the families haven’t returned out of fear or something else. My name and info was posted in another public group and now I’m getting hate mail all the time calling me a racist (I’m not) and an ignorant rich woman (not ignorant nor rich). 

I’m waiting for the hate to blow over and trying to not let all the mean comments get to me but it’s hard. I think I did what any normal person would do,  but am I the asshole for reporting this food pantry for it’s unsafe crowds?

**EDIT**: I couldn’t run anywhere else because this was a VERY established running trail that tons of people use. Where I live there are mostly highways and few sidewalks, so most people use this trail to run on if they want to jog, period. 

The trail is also well-marked and popularly known. I’ve got nothing against soup kitchens or homeless people; but I just feel like organizers should also be mindful of the community around them. The area, which was previously very safe, had become very, very sketchy in those months. There were always empty bottles of beer or other alcohol around, cigarette butts, random trash, etc. even on the trail themselves.I'm not someone who skips school regularly and it's rare for me to miss my classes but at this point, getting out of bed every morning was getting more of a challenge than usually for me. I haven't been sleeping well for month now (i would either wake up a lot in tue middle of the night or have nightmares). I can't really tell what's wrong (me and my therapist are trying to find out what is making me feel that way). 

So yesterday, when I went to see my therapist, I told her how I felt like everything is getting to much and she even said that I really was looking sickly. When she asked what I wanted to do about it, I said that maybe taking a day off would help (i know that it's not a permanent solution for my problem, but i'm trying to work something out for me). She agreed with me and I thought that I was in the right for once putting my mental health over school.

I told my mom in the evening that i wanted to take the day off and she just looked at me with this doubting expression and at this point I knew that she wasn't really believing me. She said with this stern voice "Don't let this be a regular thing." and then didn't really talk to me the rest of the evening. I felt like a horrible daughter.

This morning, I went to my sisters room and talked a little to her (she got sick, so she also stayed home that day), when my dad entered the room. Apparently, my mom told him that I was sick, too. He asked my sister how sick she felt (so that he knew if he would have to take her to the doctor right away) and she told him that she had already taken some meds, so she was feeling a little better than yesterday. He then turned to me with that grin on his face and asked in a mocking tone "And how sick are you feeling ?", and I just stayed silent, not knowing what to say, as it's really hard to explain my mental health to him (he doesn't really understand, so it's hard to talk with him about this). He just left the room, laughing and said "I know you too well".

I thought that was all but during breakfast he asked what kind of test I was trying to get around by playing sick. I never did this and seeing, that he thought about me like this hurt. I now spend the day still stressed because how guilty I'm feeling. I'm not playing sick but I they don't believe me. 

Am I in the wrong here ?



Edit: Thank you all so much for your kind words and support, I really appreciate it <3 I'm having a really good and relaxed day, so it was totally worth it to ask for that day off :)My job has a team consisting of 2 brothers and myself travelling for 4-5 days a week, at least 3 weeks a month. At first, I didn't mind sharing the room, but after 2 months and a whole year ahead of me, I started getting tired of not having any privacy. We work over 12 hrs a day in order to "make the most out of the trip" and I just want to be myself by myself at the end of the shift. Plus, they snore. AITA for bringing this up to my boss?This happened a few years ago, but I still think about it sometimes.

SO, there's this weird guy at work, we'll call him Creepy Jack.  Creepy Jack is not so bad that anyone has complained about him, but he toes that line HARD.  One day, I mentioned to a friend that my birthday was in X month and Creepy Jack overheard me.  He asks what day and I told him because I was unaware of how to express how fucking weird that was without making it weirder, so I just told him.  Lo and behold, months later, there is a wrapped package on my desk.  It is a box of children's treats, from Creepy Jack.  Happy Birthday.

I don't eat these things, and I don't really want to throw them away, so I decide to use the treats as an ingredient in a dessert dish that I then bring to work.  I feel like it might also be a way of signaling to Creepy Jack, "I don't want this" without actually having to talk to the guy.  The dish is eaten.  And to be fair, I have a few bites myself.

Later, my friends ask me what's the occasion?  What an interesting dish.  Aren't these the treats that Creepy Jack left on your desk yesterday?  I say yes and we all laugh about it, except one person.  She is scandalized that I would serve that food.  She is very concerned that it might have been "tainted" in some way (the factory seal was intact).

I . . . don't know how I feel about her complaint.  On the one hand, Creepy Jack is creepy.  Why the hell is he buying me unsolicited food anyways?  But, like, is he really going to drug something that I'll be taking home to eat and an unspecified time?  And, like I said, it was in an unadulterated box.  But, I can see how that might be something that should be disclosed BEFORE eating.  I dunno.  Judge me.

ETA:  Some common misconceptions: 

1- It didn't even occur to me that the treats might have been tampered with.  That's next level crazy.  Just that one person thought it was possible and was mad the food source was not disclosed.

2- Cooking them was dumb.  (Is that my judgement?  Alright.)  I wasn't trying to communicate to Creepy Jack, "You're a weirdo", more like "I don't accept these, but I will be as non-confrontational about it as I can possibly be.  I shall return the gift to the source."So, the context behind this is a bit strange... me and my mother were watching Harry Potter and she was talking about the snake, Nagini. I made a joke (not a very good one) that it's a slur and she can't say that. She was confused and asked why. I explained the joke telling her it sounds like the n- word, and she replied by saying the actual n- word phrased as a question.

It shocked me, because hearing the word from a white person always feels so wrong and I didn't expect her to say the actual word. So we began arguing about it. Her argument was that she wasn't saying it about or towards someone and it wasn't in a hateful way. I'm not very good at arguing, my biggest counter argument was just that if you're white, you shouldn't say it at all. Simple as that. My sister agreed with my mother. My mum continued to use the word throughout the argument, but made it a point to say that it's a horrible word that she would never directed at someone.

Hope this belongs here? Maybe it's not a situation where someone is the asshole and someone isn't. It's a fairly complex issue. Any opinions, especially from POC who I'd say have more of a right to the decision that a white person does, would be helpful.So my father-in-law, who is actually my wife's step dad, has been reaching out about my wife's student loans which are in his name. They total $28k out of a total $75k we are currently paying off. 

It's recently become a issue because his oldest son is about to graduate highschool, and he has been trying to secure loans for him to attend college. But because of his loans for my wife he is being denied. 

My wife and I finally finished paying off our credit card debt through a debt consolidation company last year and have been building our credit back up.  We have tried twice to release him from the loans being denied both times. We've paid all her loans monthly without fail, and unfortunately we were still denied. 

When he found out this week that we were denied and could not release him from the responsibility of the loans, he put my wife through a guilt trip. He was saying how unfair it was, and that his son deserve to go to college also. Even though we sympathize with that sentiment, there is nothing we can do to either pay off the loans (way too much money) or release him from the loans (the companies denied us twice for a high debt to income ratio).

After my mother-in-law texted my wife saying to please not message him anymore about the loans since he was getting visibly upset and she was getting worried. My wife informed me of all this and said she was feeling guilty for not being able to solve the issue with the loans. I told her he considered her one of his children and took out the loans knowing there was a possibility you could not pay them back immediately. I told my wife to stop talking about it with them and to not answer them anymore if they asked or badgered her. 

I considered calling him and giving him a piece of my mind but decided against it since it wouldn't help the situation. I feel like it's wrong to try and guilt trip or get upset with us about a situation we have absolutely no control over. I understand he's frustrated about his son, it won't change the fact that we can't pay off the loans.

Edit:

Just to clarify a few points:

- The $75k is only the amount we owe in student loans, not our total debt.

- We took care of our credit card debt first since it was smaller ($10k) and there were no options available to us to reconsolidate our student loans. We did it to fix our credit score and with the hope taking him off the loans, but we're denied twice by the companies.

- My FIL took out the loans in his name because my wife had already exhausted her options for financial aide, grants, scholarships, and personal loans to pay for her school. My MIL asked if he could help and he chose to take the loans so she could finish school. 

- My FIL has been bringing up the loans for almost 3 years. His oldest daughter graduated HS first but ended up joining the Navy. Now that his son is about to graduate he has ramped up his questions and even more so that he is in his last year. He has a total of 5 children not including my wife. We've tried the best we can to remove him from the loans with no luck. And have informed him every step of the way.

- Although the debt was technically my wife's before we got married, when we married we decided to pool our money together to tackle and drive down our debt wherever possible. We do not keep separate accounts.

- My Mother-in-law does not work and has no income except for what her husband brings in. So she has very few options for taking out loans for her son.

- In the end what I'm looking for is insight on if IATA for deciding to cut off communication with her parents on this particular issue? We've really exhausted all options but he continues to harass us about the loans.My (19F) boyfriend (22M) wants to visit his grandpa and parents who live in Florida. His grandpa was taken to the hospital over the weekend and they found out that he has throat cancer. My boyfriend is having a really hard time with it, because we live in Michigan and he feels guilty for not being there for his family and he was really close with his grandpa when he was younger. I’ve been trying to be as supportive for my boyfriend as I can and help him through this hard time. I’m the only person he has up here, he has some friends but tells me I'm the only one he feels truly close to.

I’m in college and my spring break is coming up in a couple of weeks. He wants to go visit his grandpa and wants me to come so I can meet his family and support him in his time of need. He wants to go the first half of my spring break then fly home on Wednesday because he can’t take off that much work.  I want to go with him as well because we’ve been together for about 10 months and I haven’t met anyone in his family yet (due to the fact that they live so far away) and I want to be there for him because I see how much pain he’s in.

I told my boyfriend I would love to go visit his family on the first half of my spring break, and that I will be there to support him as well. He planned on flying out Friday or Saturday and going back home Wednesday. My friend asked if I wanted to go on spring break with her before any of this happened and I said it sounded like fun but we never made a solid plan. She asked again to solidify a plan if we could go, and I told her the situation and she was understanding of the position I was in. She planned on driving down, so I suggested that she drives down by herself, and picks me up from my boyfriend’s family’s house on the same day that he flies back home. This works for her because shes excited she still gets to go on a trip (if I couldn’t go with her she wasn’t going).

I told my boyfriend this plan, and he got upset. He told me that he was going to need me the most when he goes home and has to leave his family, and that he either wants all of my support or none of it. That I could go on spring break with my friend or visit his family for a few days with him. I thought that it was a fair compromise on both ends. We were going on the exact same trip to see his family, minus that I wouldn’t be flying home with him, while I still get a few days away with my friend. He thinks that its unfair for him to “compromise” when he’s going through a hard time like this, but I don’t understand how he thinks he’s compromising when only a smart part of our plan changed. He thinks that I'm being selfish, and that he's allowed to be selfish and expect me to do what he says because of the situation.

Am I being selfish for wanting to go with my friend after he plans on going home?My friend was in a relationship where she was constantly being cheated on.  They have since broken up, but when we have conversations she always brings up whoever he was with in a negative way. Making snarky comments or talking about how ugly they are etc, and this is constant. 

She has also been complaining about her friends while at school. Everything they do bothers her, they’re draining or they tell her too much personal information. She complains that she’s lonely cause I’m in a relationship, but I was single the duration of her 3 year relationship in which we never saw her or spoke to her. I sent her this text: 

“I try not to get too bothered by this, and I’m saying this cause I care. When you talk about others negatively or complain about them it’s tiring to listen to. You are going to have so many people you don’t like if it’s based off of who *ex boyfriend* has talked to. I know it hurt you, but you degrading them constantly isn’t a good look.  I hope you can find peace with the situations even though you haven’t gotten closure. And when you complain about ** and ****, I think they are trying to be your friend but it seems like nothing they do is satisfactory? Like you always seem to be irritated by what they say or do and when they didn’t include you I think they knew you would say no because you don’t go out, even if it’s for personal reasons. You’ve been complaining and negative more than usual and I just want to know if you’re ok, and if you think I’m out of line with what I’m saying please let me know.” 

I also mentioned how when she talks to her toxic ex she becomes more negative and it’s frustrating to see her expect different results and to hear her complain about how poorly she was treated but continue to talk to this ex.  She complains about these friends not inviting her, but when they do she complains to our chat. I am so sick of hearing her constant complaining and tearing down of others.

She responded by saying: “I tell you guys because you guy listen but I get it now I won’t say anything. All I do is listen and help them and always putting their problems ahead of mine and I tell people who will actual  my listen and help me. But forget it” 

Am I that asshole for telling her off when she was venting again ?

-edited to remove namesMe (30) and my husband (37) met a decade ago and since then we've gotten married and had a baby. Most the time everything's perfect..
Only problem is my in-laws. Started while we were still dating. At first everything seemed fine but when we decided to live together he moved to my town which is a couple of hours away. They did not take it well, saying he was wrong and he hurt them real bad. Engagement came and in-laws got really sad/angry. Before the marriage they started being really mean, my SIL calling me childish cause I made him move away from them, telling her brother he should see a lawyer to make an agreement in case I get pregnant and run away with baby, etc. Almost called the engagement of but ultimately we figured they would eventually accept it and we really loved each other.
Fast forward a couple of years, i almost had a miscarriage and it was a really difficult pregnancy. They never came to see us. Even when the doctor told me to stay in bed we made the effort a couple of times to go see them. Baby's born healthy, I almost died due to blood loss, in-laws visit once in the hospital. When we got home we decided that we would accept visits from all friends and family but baby and me would not be doing long trips. My in-laws visited their grandchild when he was 3months. And they only came to tell their son he is such a disappointment and to tell my mother she's shit ( she was visiting as well and they showed up unannounced). Just like that and out of the blue. I was hurt but thought " my baby is much more important than all this and I want to teach family values so I'm not gonna cut contact". We continue visiting like once every 2/3 months always ignoring snarky comments towards me, my husband and the baby ( I'm to fat, husband doesn't visit enough, baby's not developing right etc.). I ignored most of it but I admit that back home I have cried non stop thinking I'm a bad mother and my child is not ok. Doctors always said baby is perfectly fine and my husband and my family are always reassuring me.
Back at December I lost it. My husband's bday is a couple of days after Christmas and since we spend Christmas with in-laws we decided to just be the 3of us on his bday. 3 days after I see Facebook. There was a comment on my husband's page from my FIL " Happy Birthday with your foster family. Hope you have fun. Your real family loves you and misses you". OUR BABY IS NOT FOSTER FAMILY. Even if we had adopted that is such an inhuman comment to make. I had this huge fight with husband because he didn't thought anything of it and now I decided we're not visiting anymore. They can come see us with an apology but I'm done. They've shown such disrespect towards their grandchild that i even said to my husband the only way he's taking the baby to his parents again is if we divorce.
I've made my decision.
My husband's sad but says he agrees with me.
Still I'm wondering... AITA here?Will I be the asshole if I leave my competitive siege team after only a few weeks when I said I was committed until the qualifiers for the semi pro league (challenger league for those in the know)

Pretty much I said I was committed to this team but really now I’m starting to realise I just don’t want to play competitive gaming anymore, it take up too much time for only a few hundred dollars in winnings a year. My last team was fantastic however recently they all retired from competitive siege. I thought I loved competitive siege but I’m starting to realise I just loved competitive siege with my previous team. I know longer want to put the hours into training and don’t get any enjoyment out of actually playing. If I leave this team there is no way they are making Challenger league however I kinda feel like there’s no chance atm even with me. 

TLDR: lost my motivation for competitive gaming but promised I would commit to this team. Will I be the asshole if I leave and retire from competitive gaming.I’m in this situation right now where a friend developed feelings for me and I can’t reciprocate (because he’s not my type).

He tried to bounce back and keep things going like nothing happened, but because of my schedule and because I’m not around to see this person as I have a close circle of friends I only really have time for, he got a bit upset that I’m not putting in the effort even as a friend, so I told him I’d be cool with messaging but beyond that (like meeting up in person) is difficult.

He’s gotten upset with me a few times over this, and my patience has been wearing thin. He eventually admitted he needed to get help because of his insecurity issues and I told him he knows what the right thing to do is. He said knows it’s been a struggle because of the feelings, and he hopes we can still at least chat and maybe meet up on occasion on my terms when I’m ready.

At this point I just ignored him, not because he’s a terrible person, but because he needs to learn that he deserves someone better than me that can meet his needs. He only messaged me once in the last couple of days by sending me a funny meme, but I didn’t reply. I think he realized what he’s been trying to do and knows he has to take a step back.

It sucks because he really is a decent person, and I want him to be happy, but I don’t feel like I am able to contribute to his growth when he still has very high expectations for me based on what he’s wanted in our relationship.

Maybe in a couple of months or so I’ll be more open to just chatting with him if I can see that he’s taking steps to improve himself. Unreciprocated feelings are the worst and most complicated thing anyone can endure, and I empathize.

EDIT- Before you say he’s a creep, I’m going to say he’s not. He hasn’t tried to physically make a move and he never said anything inappropriately graphic towards me. He also never really tried to make me change my plans to hang around him, he just saw the pattern and got upset by it.Whenever I go to the WC at school, I often notice some of the dudes don't wash their hands before leaving the bathroom (only three of all the stalls have sinks and they're on the other floors, so I know they didn't wash their hand in the stall). One of them was even the kind of person to randomly boop others' noses and all that so the first time I've seen him leaving the bathroom without washing his hands, I was even more disgusted.    
Now, I'm not a full-blown hypocondriac either, but it still makes me really uncomfortable (and I'm not even talking about the viruses that's out there... Oh wait...). I've been wanting to say something for a while, but I'm usually rather quiet so I haven't yet. 

Would I be thr asshole if I called them out ? I'm thinking a "Hey ! Aren't you forgetting something ?" as they leave. Some other students and teachers might be around so it might sound like public humiliation, but if they feel humiliated by being called out, they should wash their hands in the first place, right ? Or maybe put a sign on the door that would read "Kids learn to wash their hands after peeing in kindergarden, why are some adults still having troubles with that ?" or something like that...So two days ago, my roommate (23) and I (21) were making dinner. In my house there is 4 of us total and we tend NOT to do family style, we have our own food, with a friendlier “hey can I use that, can I use this” type of vibe. My roommate was making her rice, and found a bug 
note: she has had this same bag of rice since September. And my other roommate tends to put open jars in the dry food cabinet (ex. open pasta sauce, open bags of pasta etc.) 
We were both very grossed out and decided to completely deep clean the kitchen the next day as it was 11 at night and we were both tired. Note After we dealt with the immediate issue. Getting rid of the rice and anything else open (as in not sealed from store) or questionable right off the bat, disposed of it in the dumpster, bleached. 
I let her know that I couldn’t deep clean so until after work tomorrow at 5 pm. 
I am the one who cooks the most in the house, and I have accumulated quite a lot of stuff spices, pastas, rices. That I keep separate from that one cabinet as my mother always taught me to to take care of my food. I come home later (6pm when I was done work) to my roommates (23) and (19) having thrown virtually every single food item in the kitchen away. Including my spice sets, cooking oil, all of my stuff in the fridge, my food in our kitchen closet everything. Leaving only a handful canned good. I was mad. I said they didn’t have to do that and I was visibly mad, and said that I had the most in there and this effects me the most. Which I probably shouldn’t have even said. I have left and have been at my boyfriends since. 
My roommate texted me saying she doesn’t appreciate that I was mad after they cleaned all day and it effects everyone, they all had food they had to throw away and sent me a number of articles of things that would happen if maggots were to enter your brain etc. I said I simply wanted a text before they had done that and it was not their place to throw away all of my food in the kitchen. She said everything they threw out was expired when it truly wasn’t as I had just gone grocery shopping last week and they had thrown all of that out as well. AITA for being mad? And AITA if I ask them to at least partially reimburse me for my spice sets they threw out?
I did not think we needed to throw out everything in the kitchen and if they were doing that I feel I should have had warning in regards to my food. 

Note: Only one bug, I didn’t see it and do not know much about this so I don’t know what it was. 

Note: I deep clean often and we have only lived in this apartment since September. The house was renovated just before we moved in in September. 

Please note my kitchen is very clean lol I clean it very often, my house was just renovated before I moved in and to be honest I’m not sure it was a maggot or what, it could have been a random bug, I’m not sure I did not see it. She just said it was a maggot.The story is : i applied for a school abroad in January and got accepted lately. I did everything by myself, went through the whole process from sending the documents to the interview alone. I didn't tell anybody not even my family or friends. I got accepted, that's when i decided to tell my family. After hearing my news, my older brother decided to apply for a masters degree which is totally fine, even though he had this idea since years but has always been hesitant about it. 

The problem is: he expected me to do the whole thing for him. At first, he asked me to look up the courses that might suit him - which is something kinda dumb, how come someone who's applying for a course, not knowing what he wants- but well, i did some research and sent him what i found (i didn't do extreme efforts tbh, i just looked for basic information because i'm convinced that was up to him to look not someone else). Then, he asked me to make a resume for him which is what i did and also sent him the open file and told him to add necessary stuff that might help him get accepted. Now, he just came to me to tell me to fill the demand for him because he doesn't know how and that he hasn't time- he's a student, doesn't have daily courses, having activities outside school, meeting friends which are the things i am sacrificing for studies, freelancing to save some money for myself and helping with the house chores ( from which he's totally excused because yes, in 2020, somewhere in the world, women still cook and clean for men) in the other. so i just told him that i don't have time either but showed him how to do with the website where he needs to apply and told him to continue. He didn't like that because he's expected me to do the whole thing without a complaint and today he indirectly accused me for being selfish for obviously not wanting to do what he expected me to do. 

AITA for telling him i don't have time too to do something so basic and that he is supposed to do it himself.No explanations and I am sorry but it happened just now and I am still trying to cope.

It's 9 p.m. I love my sleep and go to bed early to stand up early for work.

If my dad would be there for me he would know that.

Instead of that he stayed away from us and just showed up when he needed something.

So, I am 26, I live in another country and have found my soul mate here. We have two sons, both not older than 3 years.

So just now my dad called me. I picked up my phone and asked 'what?'. I am an a-hole at this hours. I admit it.

My dad instantly responded with 'this is not how I raised you'.

Some background information. The first 15 years of my life, my dad didn't want to do anything with me. He basically didn't acknowledge my existence.

I said 'you didn't raise me at all, what do you want?'

'I want you to know that my wife is pregnant.'

Did I look like I cared? No.

Did I care? No.

So he told me, the woman that he banged while my mom was pregnant, is now his wife and pregnant.

My dad is about 45 now. The woman herself should be 40. Yes she was (for people who don't want to see the age I will not show it) back then, yes my dad was 20. It was in Russia and this age gap was nothing fkr them.

Anyways I told him to f* off, to never call me again and to stay out of my life.

Now AITA for that action?Ok so this happened recently at school there these two girls one of them is this new transfer student who got to know let’s call her daniel they are always taking about vags and it’s just disgusting I don’t want to bore you so I’m gonna just jump into it so I was at my desk working when my “friend” next to me daniel she started talking about her vag saying hers hurts I was discussed but she does this all the time so by now it’s normal I told her if she talks about it again ima gonna to tell the teacher and she did not want that it would tarnish her “reputation “ so she stoped but then her friend wrote something to her on a note this is the transfer student let’s call her gabby and passed it she put it in her desk and went to use the bathroom me of course curious Jorge wanted to see what it said and took it out of her desk and checked it said rats meaning people they thought were disgusting and stupid etc and had my name and others this happened many times they passed notes and giggled then went away but she always gave it back to gabby who ripped it up and threw it away of corse I had dirt on them and went to tell the teacher which chewed her out and told her mother other students near the door heard him say and miss out on the senior trip unless she had a person to go with them AITA for getting her in trouble and possibly ruining a great trip which she looked forward to ? Or everyone sucks hereSo it’s my first time posting and I’m on mobile so I apologize for any formatting issues.

I’ll begin with a bit of backstory: My (23f) former best friend (23f) who I’ll refer to as M, who was my matron of honor in my wedding and basically my other half for years, she and I no longer talk. There are many things that led up to the demise of our friendship but that’s a super long story for another day. For now we will just say that she was not there for me when I needed her and she pretty much tossed me aside.

Anyways after the fall of our friendship M continued to talk to my mom. Now M’s husband is in the military and is currently living overseas where M had been until very recently. My mother went alone to visit M last year and that was honestly really hurtful to me because of what has happened with M and I’s friendship and how she has previously treated me. I told my mom this and she still went despite knowing how upset I was.

Recently M’s husband told her he wanted a divorce. So she came back to the US and has been talking to my mother and my mom said that she was going to allow her and her child to stay with them some and even borrow their car since she does not have one. While I feel really bad for her I really don’t appreciate her continuing a relationship with my mom after her basically saying “screw you” to me and our friendship. However I tried to be empathetic and kind and reached out to her and told her how sorry I was about what she was going through and I apologized for not beign the best friend to her because I can own up to that. And I told her that I was always there for her and her child and the baby (she’s currently like 5 months pregnant). However she didn’t read the message for over a week. She stopped looking at my messages a while ago when I still was trying to talk to her and be friends so this kind of triggered all the upset feelings to come back and I told my mom to stop treating her like she’s a part of the family when she basically just tossed me and our friendship to the side. Am I the asshole for not wanting my mom to talk to someone who tossed me and our friendship aside?

Edited to add: Whenever M is around my mom acts like the world revolves around her. She doesn’t answer when I call and she ignores me to do stuff with M constantly. I know that M is more the type of daughter she always wanted because I don’t like shopping and makeup and things like that but M does. And I am having trouble getting pregnant but she treats M’s kid like that’s her grandchild. And despite me telling her time and time again how hurtful it is she continues to pretty much replace me with M.I know it sounds really bad but please let me explain.

Her period has been over a week late now. I am definitely not an expert on female anatomy but I do know that this isn't normal so we were both worried that she was pregnant. We went to do the groceries and picked up a pregnancy test. When we put away all the stuff we both went into our bedroom and she went to use the bathroom.

Lo and behold, when she comes out of the bathroom she is sobbing. Just, absolutely bawling and in hysterics. It was extremely worrying. I dropped what I was doing and asked her if everything was okay and she didn't respond so me being the idiot that I am, asked if she was pregnant. She looked at me like I committed a crime and said "no you retard I left the package downstairs on the counter". I obviously apologized for this but that didn't stop the tears from coming (before I go on let me say that she ended up taking the test and it was negative, and her period also came). The crying got progressively worse and I tried to give her a hug but she turned away from me. I was racking my brain for what I did wrong but I couldn't think of anything that I did. She then went to go sit on the couch and I went to sit next to her and I tried to hold her hand and rub her back but she *removed my hand from her's and then turned away from me so that she was facing the other side of the sofa.*

Something similar has happened before. When she gets upset she just completely shuts down mentally and doesn't say or do anything (before anybody asks, no she is not on the spectrum) until she "gets a chance to process her emotions". The only difference is that this time her body language and mannerisms indicated that she didn't want anything to do with me. So I didn't do or say anything and I sat next to her and waited for her to calm down. I don't want to go into the details but it turns out that she misses her mom. Who lives a 20 minute drive away.

After she got a handle on herself she lashed out at me and asked me why I didn't do anything to comfort her. I was completely floored because I DID try, literally everything I did she turned down and she completely shut me out for no reason that I can think of. She wanted me to apologize but I said nah screw that I'm not apologizing until you tell me what caused you to treat me that way. She's had no response to that thus far.So My(m21) girlfriend (f19) got super dressed up this morning and was looking good. So I told her over FaceTime that she looked good, especially in the jeans. Soshe said she was gonna go show her Lesbian friend “Jessica” the outfit in the living room. So she goes and Jessica (gay) starts telling her how good she looks which I’m fine with but then My gf says something like “ my butt looks good in these pants and I’m assuming she showed her. Jessica continues on talking and says Hey man you better treat her right or I’m gonna have to take her from you” in a joking manner. 1. Why are you pointing out your more sexual parts to a girl who you know is gay? Whether she likes her like that or not. I asked her if she would do the same if a guy was there and she was like “depends on how close I am to the guy, it’s not a big deal because Jessica is my best friend. I told her that would be completely unacceptable and make me very uncomfortable. 2. I’ve met this Jessica girl a few times but I just don’t care for her a whole lot. I have a good feeling that she used to like my gf before I came into the picture and she has a bad habit of making those types of “jokes” about my gf when I don’t know her like that. Now I’m annoyed that my gf fought with me about it rather than just respecting that it made me uncomfortable and stopping the action. AITA?

TLDR; gf shows off how good her butt looks in jeans to lesbian friend. I get very uncomfortable and tell her to stop doing that. Gf defends her friend.I am a guy, my girlfriend and I have been dating for about 5-6 months. Today we have an issue because we set a time to meet and talk out some things, and last night she brought a plant over, and whoever has the plant is supposed to do the talking, right? No rebuttals to each other while we have the plant. One can ask the other for the plant, but we are both free to say no, for any reason. I let her have the plant, and besides "I hear you", or "that is valid" or "can I hear more about that?" very sparingly (active listening, basically), she was uninterrupted by me. When I got the plant and started talking, she escalated and began getting louder/speaking over me. After it started to keep happening, I took a deep breath and said "I have the plant, I want it to be my turn. Are we still doing the plant thing?" and that set her off. She snatched the plant off the table, and said "NO! We aren't doing the plant anymore", and when I asked her if we could take a deep breath, she left my room and went into the common area where my roommates (nobody else was home) and I share a kitchen and bathroom and sobbed very loud for 10-15 minutes.

Today, I contacted her and asked to meet in person. Amongst some other things about how I feel like a lot of the time she communicates indirectly and puts me down because I don't get that one thing is supposed to mean another, that the plant thing and the sobbing were uncomfortable to me. I understand its not voluntary. I told her that as a black man of my stature and identity (6 ft athletic build black dude, not a humble brag, but its true that people OFTEN assume scary things about me, especially in confrontation), people who walk by are likely to assume I am an aggressor and treat me accordingly. I told her we can't control other people, but its my reality that I don't want my RA to come have to see about me for a noise complaint/wellness check  especially if the whole thing kicked off because I (calmly) asked for some room to speak. My RA didn't come, and it was definitely loud enough and late at night where a noise complaint could've happened. My floor is not super big, and anyone walking by would hear it, and they also know that I live here too. I shared that the assumption and situation is uncomfortable to me, because for anyone else in the vicinity, people treat me differently because a woman sobbing in my room very much sounds like I am an aggressor. I told her I want her to have space to be sad and cry, and I explicitly communicated that I also want something that works for both of us, so I asked her to let me know what boundaries and space she needs from me and how I can encourage it so that she can express herself how she needs to. She cut me off mid thought and walked out. AITA for asking her to not sob so loudly in the common area, or for any of the other things, and AITA for asking her to let me finish my thought, which is what seemed to make her cry in the first place?I (42F) would like to back out of being a bridesmaid in my husband's sister's (29F) wedding. I hate being a bridesmaid. My sister-in-law asked me to be a bridesmaid knowing this. She said that otherwise I would be the only sibling in her family that wouldn't be in the wedding party and as my husband is a groomsman "people would talk" and that would distract from "her day". So, I agreed.

Cut to this week. She has sent me a document that includes my duties for the wedding. I have expressed that I am not willing/able to do this list. But, she insists that it is normal and I would be selfish to not make it perfect.

* Design all of her invitations, programs, signage, website, etc. for free. I am a full-time professional designer. She also refuses to sign my pro-bono contract that stipulates things like number of revision rounds, licenses, etc. "because we are family." She did not ask me to do this. She said it would be "my special job". The other bridesmaids' "special jobs" are things like collecting and dropping off tuxes after the wedding.
* Drive to (6.5 hour drive) and pay for overnight accommodations for every event she has planned, including 2 wedding dress shopping weekends, a wedding planning weekend, bridal shower, dress fitting, a decoration weekend, and be in town for a full week before the wedding to assist her in "whatever comes up". Her other bridesmaids live less than 2 hours from her.
* Attend her destination bachelorette party for 6 days for $2400 (this cost covers me and a share of her expense so that she pays nothing).
* Purchase and wear a tube top dress (held up with only elastic bands above and below the bust) made of a single layer of lightweight fabric ($120). Problems: 1) I am a heavier, older woman who needs a G-cup supportive bra with straps. 2) Her wedding is outdoors in November in Wisconsin.
* Purchase and wear a bra, underwear, and robe set ($175) that she has picked out and wear it while getting ready and be photographed in it. The largest size is a size too small and am very uncomfortable about being photographed even if it is only for her "personal album".
* Purchase two pairs of shoes ($120) that she has picked out: heels for the ceremony and ballet flats for the reception. I get ingrown nails easily and so my podiatrist has told me not to wear these types of shoes that push down on my nails. My sister-in-law said that it would only be for a "few" hours (approx. 2PM-1AM) and so I should be able to deal with it.
* Purchase and wear a set of costume jewelry that she picked out ($50). I have a major allergy to most metals that make me break out in hives if worn for any period of time. 

With her unwillingness to make any concessions, I would like to tell her I cannot be in the wedding. She already has (without me included) seven bridesmaids (all of which are between the ages of 20 and 29, BTW). WIBTA if I backed out even though I agreed to do it and it would mean being the only one not in the wedding party?So my friends and I (16F) were playing football (soccer) yesterday after school (yes, we all love a game of football) and one of them (15M) accidentally blasted the ball in my face, giving me a slight bruise.

I was angry at him and asked him what on earth was that for. He rushed over to me and apologised profusely and mentioned that he was trying to clear the ball but didn't see me near him. I got mad and yelled at him that I'm hurt now and that "sorry" won't fix the damage he's done.

He thought about it for a while, then ran to the shops and returned with an ice pack. With a cheeky smile, he said "No, but this might do the trick" and stretched out his hand to give the ice pack to me. A few of our friends were laughing at the joke, but I didn't find it funny, slapped it out of his hand and told him to piss off and left the pitch, leaving him standing all alone with a few friends left.

When I got home, after pondering about it for a while, I realised that I had made a terrible mistake and wanted to apologise to him. I sent him a long message, explaining that I was hurt, angry and wasn't thinking straight and that I thought of his joke as an offensive one rather than a friendly one at the time and that most of all, I'm sorry.

He replied with a rolling eye emoji and didn't send anything else after that and now I'm wondering if it's his turn to over-react now. AITA?So today in our little group of friends a rather religious guy was freaking out because some writer made blasphemous comments in one of his books, so I told him to not care about what others say. That's when this dumbass friend of mine jumps in the chat and goes all like "so you think you're better than us, we get it you hate our religion" I tried explaining what I meant to say for half an hour until I got tired and simply said that he's too much of a dumbass to comprehend what I said. Now he's refusing to talk to me and also kicked me out of the group. So AITA for calling him a dumbass?First off, I'm still living with my parents and in school, and so is my girlfriend. Her parents aren't together anymore and she only sees her dad like once every 2 to 3 months. This weekend, they were supposed to meet up for the first time since Christmas.

The issue is that her dad was recently in Rome, Italy and returned today symptom-free. Yet, the incubation period for Corona is 14 days, so if she would go to see him, there would be a small but realistic chance she'd get infected, thus exposing me to the virus before she would know she had it as well.

She asked me if she should go see him and I told her I wouldn't, but it would still be her decision to make. The only thing I said was that if she went to see him, I wouldn't meet up with her for the next two weeks because I didn't want to be at risk of getting the disease. This is not only because of myself but also because both of my parents are at a higher risk of suffering or even dying from it (because of asthma and rheumatism).

Now she kinda blames me for putting pressure on her because I am "threatening" to withdraw myself from her if she went to see her dad. AITA for issuing this kind of ultimatum?title says the most of it but let me elaborate.

This guy judged me for my past toxic relationship with a woman who lied multiple times, he went to defend her side for months even though most of the times i didnt do anything wrong, whenever an argument came i had to defend myself against 6-7 of her friends.

after that relationship i met my now girlfriend who i've been with for one and a half years.

He tried to break us up multiple times aswell as talk badly about me behind my back to her and my best friend.

Later my girlfriend got drunk and ended up cuddling with this guy (we had agreed beforehand that would be cheating)

he's made remarks about my girlfriend like he wants to get her drunk and so on again

I told her i wasnt comfortable with her sleeping at his place and that i dont want her to do so in the future, she then says that she doesnt do that to my friends and she now ignores me and doesnt want to talk to me

Am i the asshole?I (33m) am a lawyer in a smallish office, there are around 30 people including support staff. I have worked here for 8 years. The average age is probably 45 but there's a group around my age. 

Around 8 months ago, we hired a new paralegal L (f25) who I liked immediately. From how she acts I would not have guessed she was 25 or that this is her 1st full time office job.

L and I have a teasing/joking relationship. We will often stop by each other's offices to share a funny story or whatever. It seemed like flirting but I  wasn't sure. 

A few weeks ago our coworker's band had a show. L told me that she and some other coworkers were going and that I should come too. Turns out we're the only people from our office who went, so we hung out and talked the whole time. I tried a few flirty arm/shoulder touches which she seemed fine with. To say goodbye I gave her a hug and a kiss on the cheek.

I thought about it all weekend and decided to ask L out. At work on Monday I asked L to come to my office. I told her that I value our working relationship and would never want to jeopardize that, but that I would love to see her more outside of work. L was visibly surprised and said that she would be happy to see me outside of work as a friend. I was obviously very embarrassed and changed the subject. I have not brought it up again.

However, L has been acting uncomfortable around me ever since. Where before she would come into my office to talk about a case, sit down, and hang out a bit, now she stands in the doorway and leaves as soon as possible. She has not initiated a social conversation or addressed me directly in a group setting. When I joined a conversation between L and a coworker, L moved to the other side of the coworker's desk. The other day she went into the lunchroom, saw only my stuff there, and left for 10 minutes until more people arrived (she doesn't know I saw that,  I was in the kitchen).

Clearly I made her uncomfortable by asking her out. I tried to do it as respectfully as I could, but AITA for asking her out in the first place?

TL;DR I asked out a coworker and now she's uncomfortable,  AITA?I (30F) am currently stalmating with my (32M) husband over a argument that happened with our friends over the weekend. It led to my husband feeling that another couple who ended up leaving the chat after the confrontation had dishonored him by dismissing his experiences and accusing him of being extremely mean. They left because my husband blocked them both on another social media site, they felt like they couldn't reach out and that he had severed ties for good.
I believe its not okay that they made him feel that way. They need to apologize to him. But when I confronted him, saying that he shouldn't have blocked them, that he escalated the situation he accused me of not siding with him, that if we were a team id agree with him and stonewall our two friends. But I have discussed with them what happened and I wholeheartedly believe it was them not handling the situation well, that they are remorseful for making him feel like his traumas were dismissed, and that they insinuated he was a bully.

Now my husband is stonewalling me saying that i don't love him, thatI i don't accept his boundaries and how he enforces those boundaries. That im siding with them, that i want him to be a doormat for others to tramp on. I keep telling him that i am siding with him, because i don't believe it was right what happened, but that as his wife and partner, challenging him to be open to apology and criticizing how he enforces his boundaries doesn't mean i don't love him or want him to be a doormat. Honestly i don't want him to be, i just feel he needs to not be so aggressive when people cross certain boundaries, and to hear them out once and then determine if they're genuine. I don't like the idea that if i was his partner and we were a team id be agreeing with him and giving them the same cold shoulder and stonewall he is giving them. So am i the asshole?My fiancé and I have been together for almost four years now. He is my everything and I would never do anything to intentionally hurt him. My fiancé was born in a country where it is mandatory for men to serve in the military for about two years. He enlisted in 2017 and was finally discharged last summer. I have this one ex who I have been on and off with since I was 14. I was 22 when I ended things with him for good (I actually broke up with him for my current fiancé) and I know it broke his heart but I thought he would understand that in the end we weren’t right for each other. But I was wrong. 

He moved on and found a new woman to make him happy and I was genuinely happy for him but in December 2018, he contacted me. He told me that he was getting married to his girlfriend but he still had feelings for me, and he wouldn’t marry her if there was still a chance that we could be together again one day. I told him that I am happy with my fiancé and that there is no future for us and then he hung up on me. I never spoke to him again after that. I have always been honest with my fiancé and I had every intention on telling my him what happened but I believed that it would be best not to tell him at that time because he was enlisted. He was already going through the stress of being in the army I didn’t want to add on to that, especially because we couldn’t talk whenever we wanted to. So I was afraid that he was going to turn it into something bigger in his mind and it was going to drive him crazy while we so far away from each other. I decided to just have that talk with him when he got discharged, but when he finally did I was too excited and happy to be with him again that the whole situation just never crossed my mind. So I never actually told him what happened. 

Fast forward to now, my fiancé and I are more in love than ever and happily living together. A few days ago we had friends over and ended up playing ‘Never Have I Ever’ and one of my friends said ‘Never have I ever messaged to an Ex while with my current bf’ and I suddenly remembered the confession so I put my finger down and everyone started ‘ooh’-ing and pushing me to tell what happened and I just brushed it off and said it was nothing serious or romantic and we continued playing. After our friends left he asked me about speaking to my Ex and I told him everything and explained why I didn’t tell him when it happened and he got upset. I have tried to explain my reasoning but he says I should have just told him anyways, no matter what.

I love him more than anything I am afraid that I have ruined his trust in me and hurt our relationship. I was trying to be considerate of his feelings while he was in the army but because of his reaction now I feel like I did the wrong thing by not telling him.

AITA?Me and 3 guys moved into a house.  We were planning to throw a house warming party that also celebrated the birthday of one of the roomates.  One friend took charge in planning everything.  He basically planned for just drinking and snacks.  

A friend texted me that they heard the roomate complaining about the birthday party.  The roommate isn't really in to drinking and is more of a games activities type.  So I texted the roomate who was planning things about my concerns about wanting to add activites to the party that the birthday guy would want to take place in.  **The planning roomate had thrown me a birthday party before that he basically just turned into a party for himself and I felt like that was happening again and wanted my roomates to not have to deal with that.**

The planning roomate took screenshots of my text and sent them to the birthday roomate.  The roomate, put on the spot about complaining about the party behind his back, of course denied complaining and said he was fine with the party as planned.  The planner then accused me of using this as my way of trying to change the party that the other 3 had agreed on into something just I wanted.  I was furious that he had taken screenshots of what I viewed as a private conversation and sent them to my other roommate.  He basically flipped the situation to make me look like an asshole.  I got pissed and basically said throw whatever party you want and I un-RSVP'd on Facebook.  I did end up going.

The party happened and went fine, but I'm still wondering if I handled this right.My girlfriend and I both go to the same college and so we often times will sleep over at each others places. This is great, absolutely love it, but the problem is that she won't sleep over with me / let me sleep over unless I commit to waking her up (and thus me also waking up) at a specified time in the morning. I get that this is probably the dumbest AITA you've ever stumbled across, but it does cause a lot of tension in our relationship. Her side is that it's not that big of a deal for me to do such a small thing and that she has a hard time getting up if she sees I sleep in. My side is that 1) I already hate waking up early, 2) it sucks waking her up (she'll pull the sheets over her head, moan, get cranky, basically do anything not to wake up) and 3) why is it MY responsibility for you to start your day on time? AITA?So, I'm in 11 different discord servers, most of which are owned by me. If you don't know what discord is, it's pretty much Skype/Team speak. In one of the servers, we talk about how our day has gone, roleplay, NSFW stuff, etc. It has a specific category labeled "Vent" with different channels. Some of the channels are "anxiety", "depression", "mental issues", etc. I have severe anxiety and depression so I use those channels a lot. In the "mental issues" one, someone mentioned that they find death very peaceful and said something like "Just the thought of someone dying is peaceful" and then we started down on that topic. I didn't get in until really late and it was slowing down, like people were getting ready to log off. I said something that offended another person and the conversation is as followed: 

my friend: yeah, i mean, watching some go peacefully is nice but like.. no burning

me: i see where ya'll are coming from. definitely feel the same way about that but all forms of it

admin: OP, you're saying that if your best friend burned, you wouldn't be sad?

me: that's.. not what i said

admin: yeah, no. you cant talk about this stuff here. we want it to be a safe place and want everyone to feel welcomed. not that you want to burn them.

me: but.. i don't want to burn them and this is literally called "mental issues". if you don't want me posting here, turn my permissions off to here (there's a way to do so in the settings)

admin: i just might. and maybe the entire server. we don't want someone to be killing anyone here

me: so... you're going to turn my permissions off so i cant do anything because i was talking about the topic?

admin: no, i'm turning off your permission because the topic was over and you had no reason to. also, i'm changing your roles. i thought you were a good person. turns out you're not

my friend: you're really going to take things away from him because you don't want to have him talking?

admin: its keeping people safe

At this point, I had no permissions and told my friend so. it was amazing why he didn't just kick me from the server. I was really frustrated and was ready to just leave it at that. He ended up taking away a bunch of my self given roles (i was an admin for a long time) and left me with pyro. i ended up messaging him and asking what he was doing. he told me that what he was doing was keeping people safe and away from me. i told him that he needed to stop acting like a child and stop treating me like i'm a threat. he got really offended and reported me. my discord account has been suspended for a few weeks. so am i the asshole for talking about something in the right spot?I've been friends with this girl for about 3 years now and I've sort of taken her under my wing as she's very introverted. I have a problem where I'm very generous with my money and constantly lend it to people or buy them drinks/meals when we're out; a lot of people have taken advantage of this. I've always justified it by the fact that I earn a lot and just want people to have fun when we're out. Over the years however I've started to have some self respect and know when people are taking the piss. 

When I've been out I've always done round with this girl or she'll offer to get me a drink when she's up, so in my eyes she's good people. I'll always buy a few extra rounds when we're out or pay for dinner if we're doing something alone. No ulterior motive, as I said I just want people to have a good time and not have to worry about their finances. 

She recently started dating some guy who took an instant dislike as we're close and has seen me as sort of a rival. I'm just happy for her so I put up with her jibes and even offered on getting him a few rounds when we're out, but he always insist on buying me a round or saying no so I let it slide. 

A few weeks ago her bag was stolen and she lost her Nintendo switch. Her birthday was coming up so I bought her a new one with her two favourite games and handed them over at the small party we had. Her BF was not happy and stormed out of the room and confronted me when I was in the loo. Apparently I'm trying to buy her love or undermine him, I apologised and said he was wrong and left it at that?

AITA here? I've got the cash to spare and don't want anything back. I'm not interested in her at all and I just like seeing my friends happy.I (20F) recently became friends with another person (20F). We were talking one day and she mentions that she is a lesbian. I tell her that I don't care, meaning her sexuality doesn't affect how I see her. It doesn't bother me that she is gay, it doesn't affect me. I told her that her sexuality doesn't concern me in a friendship. She immediately takes offense to this. She says, "How can you not care? It is 2020! Don't you care about gay rights?" And I was a little taken aback because i guess she misunderstood what I say by "I don't care". Perhaps I was a little blunt when I said "I don't care", but should I have had a nicer response? I told her," Of course I care about gay rights, its just that sexuality has nothing to do with a friendship. I like people for who there are. I dont "care" because your sexuality doesn't matter to me." She proceeds to say,"So LGBT people don't matter to you?? This is why people are so afraid to come out!" 

At this point I was fucking speechless. this girl was completely twisting my words. I meant that sexuality doesn't matter because you should see people as there are. Your sexuality is apart of you, not all of you. I just don't think ur sexuality should be a personality trait thats all. idk what do you guys think?


edit: wow, so surprised by the amount of responses! its so interesting to hear ur differing opinions. thanks so much!So, some background for this story, I am the one who started this D&D group with my friends, but recently I took a break from DM-ing while I figured out how to make the final dungeon run smoothly. In that break, my friend decided to run his own game, with me and the others as players. 

The main problem with said game is that it is total anarchy. We started the first session with a wild west style "hunt some outlaws" mission. It ended with us evacuating said wild western town, and a plot to resurrect a long-dead lich. The second session in a new town, trying to figure out why people were disappearing. It ended with us fleeing the city due to a one-off joke that got way out of hand. This is just an example of how stupid it got sometimes. 

The only character that is really important to this story is mine, because they are the focal point of the argument. I made a Lizardfolk monk, who I was going to make a way of the 4 elements.  This sort of pertains to his backstory. He comes from a tribe with inherited elemental powers. His powers don't manifest when his friends' do, and he is ridiculed.

A major part of the whole "inherited powers" thing is that you get the elements from your parents. Mostly, people just marry and such with their own element. However, my character is born  of an affair. This would give my characters two elements to use, and hopefully, some interesting character interactions. Keep in mind, I have told him how I want my backstory to work in the game, and up to that point, he thought it was going to work well in his game. 

Then, a couple days ago, he messaged me about having an idea for what to do next session. Now, I can't make it to next session due to other obligations. But that didn't stop him from telling me his plan.

His plan, in short, was to have a town with some racial tension be the next place we visit. He would make it so that the current leader dies, and we have a part in deciding who would be next. However, both people running are part of a group that wants to do a lot of bad. He wanted to end this session with my character, powers fully revealed pre-3rd level, as a REINCARNATED LIZARDFOLK HERO, WHO KILLS BOTH OF THE PEOPLE RUNNING FOR OFFICE.

Needless to say, I was kind of upset that he made such a drastic change to my backstory without my knowledge, and then have this happen while I'm not there. I try and give hints that I *really* don't want this massive change to happen. He continues to try and give reasons for why it would work, and how he wants to leave the session on a good cliffhanger.

At this point, I just decided to say what I was thinking: I didn't want such a sudden change to who my character was, out of nowhere, while I have 0 control.  He finally backed off, and said he would try to come up with something. He hasn't messaged me about it since, and now I just feel like a douche. So tell me reddit: Am I the Asshole?I'm working on a presentation with this guy in class. We tried to sort out a time to meet and realised that we wouldn't both be available at a time the library was open. He suggested that he go and get what we need from the reference books and then I came to his place and we worked on it together there.

He lives off campus. I get there, there's 4 chairs in the main room, plus this leather bench, I move towards one, but then he sits on the bench, and tells me to come sit next to him so we can both see the laptop. It was actually pretty comfortable, but it's only as I'm leaving that I see this wavy line across it. I ask where he got it and he tells me an adult toy store, and then proceeds to pull it apart to show me how it's actually 2 curved leather sex benches stacked on top of each other (so the curves line up).

I don't think he'd have ever done anything untoward, but just the idea of sitting on a bench he's had sex on is weird to me. I know that sounds ridiculous as, logically, at some point someone has probably had sex on every surface I've ever sat on (hell, I know firsthand that someone has had sex on the chair I'm sitting on), and I actually own something similar to what he has, but I feel like if I'm having someone over then I put it in the bedroom, or put something over it, or at least I don't suggest they sit on it. Of the 4 other chairs he had 3 of them were lightweight ones that he could have easily put closer together if the concern was us sharing a screen. Like I said, I don't think he would have done anything, but it's just weird that of the 5 seating options he had, he went for the one where the primary purpose of this item isn't sitting, it's having sex, and sitting is like a bonus.

So we did about 1/2 of the project at his place, and we still need to do the other half. He asked when I wanted to come over to finish it, and I suggested we meet in the library this time. He said his flat is "easier" and we can eat/drink at his place, which we can't do at the library (aside from bottled water), and read over the presentation out loud (no enforced silence in library but making noise is usually seen as a dick move). I suggested the cafe and he said he didn't want to read the presentation aloud in public as it would make him self conscious, and then asked if I had a problem going to his place. I said there was no problem, it's just easier for me to stay on campus.

I then get a message from him saying he knows the bench made me uncomfortable, calling me a prude, saying it's just furniture and he's not sure how owning a bench has resulted in me not liking him any more and I've made him feel bad by not wanting to come to his place again. I now feel bad for making him feel bad.

AITA for not wanting to go to his flat because of the bench?

Info: I'm a womanHer dress ripped down the middle and the only reason I noticed it cause she sat down and stood back up to grab her water bottle. I didn’t wanna seem like a weirdo that was checkin her out or embarrass her so I didn’t say nothing. She obviously doesn’t notice. She seems really nice but I don’t really talk to her at all unless she has a question or needs notes. But sexual charges nowadays happen all the time so I didn’t even wanna say anything for any reason. She’s been at school for a couple hours now so who knows how long it’s been like that.

AITA for pretty much thinkin purely of myself?

Edit: A lot of you are right, it was messed up to not say anything, I shoulda just helped her out and told her to save her any more embarrassment.I have a best friend named John. Our wive's were best friends before we met. Our kids have grown together. Basically we are really close.

We all have a playful relationship with each other. When we are around each other, we sometimes make playful jokes about each others wife's being sexy and stuff like that.

Until a few months ago, I saw john grab my wife's ass as she walked by. I also noticed some weird comments made between the two. Thinking it was a just a joke, I pretty much wrote it off at that point.

On valentines day, we had plan's to spend the day together. I wake up in the morning and my wife informs me that John had texted her that he had a dream about her. Half asleep, I don't think much of it, but as I smoke my cigarette and wake up a bit I have a weird feeling about it. Wife goes to take a shower and I get a bit curious. She leaves her apple watch on the counter, so I check the messages. John had texted my wife at about 5:30 am that he had a dream about her in some kind of dress of some sort. My wife responded with I thought you would have dreamed of me naked on a beach somewhere. I immediately confronted my wife about it. Asked her if she thought this was an appropriate conversation to be having with John. First she wanted to talk about it, when I refused she got offensive and turned it around on me because I was accusing her of cheating. We both apologized to each other the next day. I apologized for overreacting and she apologized for giving me any reason to think that something would be going on between her and John.

At this point, I had not talked to John about it at all. That's what I tend to do when I'm mad at someone. I just don't speak to people when I am not happy with them. After about a week, myself and my wife gets a text message from John's wife explaining that she thinks that this has been blown all out of proportion and John was not wrong. He had said nothing sexual towards my wife. She also said I should be ashamed of myself to ever think that John or my wife would do something like that to us. She also said that we are always joking with each other and that's all that it was.

So finally I responded, explaining my feelings that a joke between friends in front of each other is totally different than having a private conversation talking about such things. I explained that I thought that it was inappropriate. I also admitted that I had mishandled the situation. I should have talked to John about it instead of ignoring him.

I immediately get a response basically accusing me of not allowing John to talk to my wife, accusing me of ruining things between us and our kids. Basically putting all of the blame on me. I basically told them to fuck off and have a nice life after that.

To top it all off, my wife and I aren't on speaking terms.  When talking about what they said, she seems to be radio silent, like she doesn't know what to say to me. Maybe she agree's with them now.

So AITA in this situation?I live in Japan. As you know, Japan and South Korea are the 2 worst hit countries with the corona virus. Wedding is on end of April, so about 2 more months. They would not consider postponing it even though they've already registered with the city hall so technically they're married so i don't know what's the rush?

I need to rsvp by end of March. Btw, it's my wife's elder sister's wedding. She came to my wedding last November so i guess she must've secretly envied her younger sister getting married first therefore now she's trying to rush. I'm thinking of not going, but i would still give her money as tradition. AITA if i don't go? My father in law will probably kill me though.

**EDIT:** Apparently i didn't tell the story well enough cos everyone kept asking the same questions so here are some additional info.

* I live in Japan. My in laws are Japanese. Wedding is in Japan, same place where i live. Distance is not a problem at all.
* I am genuinely concerned about the virus, i don't know what's gonna happen after 2 months. If the wedding is tomorrow then yeah sure i'd go... but it's 2 months later.
* I don't like my SIL as a person. She's always stealing our thunder. We got married, then she immediately got married. We held our wedding then she wants to have her wedding too why so inconsiderate? Think about the guests.... Why not just postpone? But whatever. Btw, i have not met her husband. I asked to meet on weekends but he said he wants to play basketball during the weekend so no. Also, she gave me and her sister $200 for our wedding (The average rate for a friend's wedding is $300, this is her own sister but she gave $200 and she is a scientist for a pharmaceutical company). To rub salt into wounds, our neighbor gave us $500 and we barely talk. I don't want to go to her wedding but i plan to give her $1000.... to show her i am the bigger man. I am not rich, but i can afford $1000 as a sign of respect to her father. If you can't already tell, basically she rubbed me off the wrong way on a lot of things. They all add up, so i don't really like her. Oh, and how do i know she is rushing to get married? 'cos her then-boyfriend of 6 months didn't even propose to her. She proposed to him and he's like whatever. Just not a genuine and sincere person. She also secretly cheated on her previous bf.I work in a professional building (multi-leveled with multiple businesses).Most days I’m pretty business dressed (some days even suits and ties). Today I’m wearing a stones t-shirt, jeans, and boots (with t-shirts my tattoos stick out slightly below the sleeve cuffs). 

Anyways I head to use the restroom and as I am leaving a doctor from the insurance exam business next door is leaving a stall and walks out the door without washing his hands.

“Aren’t you going to wash your hands with all the virus stuff going on in the news?” I asked

He looked me up and down and replied, “Mind your own business!”

“Yeah, next time you’re in here reaching for it, I hope your Dick falls off!” 

TLDR: dirty mf didn’t wash hands. Told him I hope his dick falls off.

Edit: Thanks for the comments. I knew what was coming for me when I posted. Have at least enjoyed reading your thoughts about the situation.

My sister (45F) is dying of cancer, after fighting it for several years. I (42F) am currently sitting by her hospice bed, where she’s been for the past three weeks. Our dad (75M)? He’s on holiday - left on Saturday for Ibiza with his gf.

He has never helped my sister in the years she’s been sick, or before that. My two siblings and I live in different cities, and have for the last 22 years, and he’s never once visited my sick sister or me, offered to help us move/ spend time with his only grandchildren, or even invited us to his 50th, 60th, 70th or 75th birthday dinners. A year and a half ago, he travelled by car past the city my sister lives in on his way home from spending a couple of weeks on holiday just south of her city- without visiting, while she was recuperating from chemotherapy. His step-son-in-law was driving the car, and my dad called as they drove past, excusing not stopping by saying his step-SIL was starting a new job over the weekend.   


My sister’s cancer diagnosis was always terminal, it was discovered too late, but she’s been such a fighter. She was so angry with the way our dad treated her, she doesn’t want him to visit her now. But our sibling lives in the same city as him, and they have anxiety and is physically disabled. It is especially hard on them, as my mom and step-dad are here, and have been for most of the past years caring for my sister, and so they are alone. Our dad didn’t even think to help my sibling at this time, he went on holiday with his step children and step grandchildren instead.

So, WIBTA if I low key refuse to talk to him, comfort him or acknowledge him if he makes it back in time for the funeral? I say low key, as in trying to do it without making it difficult for the rest of my family, who don’t deserve me making a scene of cutting him with open hostility? I blocked him on my phone after the last travel incident, and my family knows that.My girlfriend (23) and I (22) moved in together 8 months ago, her brother (21) had dropped out of college and was working in the same city as us but moved back with his dad when his lease was over, which is in a different town. He decided that he would keep his job and have his grandpa drive him since his grandpa works in the same city as us. Their grandpa is semi-retired, he works Monday-Thursday, so her brother can only work those days, but he has no bills to pay other than paying back his student loans. At some point he messaged my girlfriend and asked if he could stay with us for a week so he could work, she asked me and I was on board, thinking that this might happen every once in a while. Also, we have a spare bedroom but it's my office, with my PC. At the time I was doing my internship so I didn't have much work to do at home. As time went by, the visits got more frequent, and I started school again, so I needed the office.

When he started asking to come and stay with us during school I was like whatever it's going to be this once and it will be over, but then he asked again, and during my midterms, keep in mind these are not short two day visits. I started to get more and more frustrated because this is my last semester in school and I just needed my space, I would go and spend upwards of 14 hours at school because I did not get my space or privacy at home. He sleeps until 2pm, is very loud and aggressive, and is not observant about how we go about our day to day lives. I had a chat with my girlfriend about this and suggested he maybe find a place here if he really likes his job, find another job where he lives, or get his drivers license. She had a talk with him, and he would just shake his head. She then went on and started to look for places for him everyday, and sends him whatever she finds appropriate, she also suggested that if any of the places she sends appeal to him that he should jump on them because they go quick, and he just brushes it off.

Today, we get a message that he has to stay with us again, this is the third time in one month, keep in mind he does not pitch in on groceries or anything while he is here. I tried to have a conversation with my girlfriend but she got frustrated and started questioning our future living together because she thinks I am not welcoming.

When he first asked to come and stay with us my girlfriend had complimented me on being so nice and patient with the whole situation, since I would hangout with him all the time because she would be at work. But now all of a sudden because I am starting to feel like this is taking a toll on me, I am the asshole. Our apartment is tiny. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong here, and if not how to approach her without seeming like I don't want to help.Uh, hi! First post on this site (heard about it on George Takei’s Instagram), but this is really making me wonder and I would like some outside opinions. 


So, I recently had my 22d birthday, and I got a few gifts and cards, mostly from family members. I am someone who is usually a stickler about sending thank you notes, it’s how I was raised and I have done it for every gift I have gotten. 


For the past several years many relatives have not sent my family (or me, if I was the sole giver) any acknowledgment or thank-you of any sort for any gifts given at any event/holiday during the year, and that includes two of the people who sent me a gift this year. I know nobody is entitled to a thank-you, even when the gifts have been large or time-consuming handmade items, but it does leave one feeling rather unappreciated. 


It’s not that they don’t write them at all, they will send them to “important” members of the family (my grandparents/their parents, and geographically close relatives that live 5-10 minutes away... we live about an hour away). And they were kind enough to think of me on my birthday, which I am very grateful for, so I realize that that fact alone makes me kind of an AH for not wanting to send a thank-you note. The thing that gets me frustrated is that they say how much they enjoy and appreciate getting thank-you notes from my family/me, and I know they would be upset if they weren’t thanked/acknowledged in some way, but they have not reciprocated when given a gift from us in several years. I’m just getting sick of the double standard. 


WIBTA if I did not send thank-you notes to the two relatives who gave me a gift, but never send our family thank-you notes? I know I might be TA here, and am happy to accept all y’all’s verdict, I just would like some outside opinions. (Also, I’ll probably end up sending them a thank-you, regardless so as not to cause family drama)I’m godmother to my cousin’s child; godson just had his 8th birthday. Prior to his birthday I spoke to my cousin, his mother, to find out what she and his father were getting him for his birthday so we didn’t each get him the same thing. She showed me the LEGO set they were ordering for him and I saw that it cost about $90. I didn’t want to show them up, so I got him an RC car that cost me around $50. I thought this was the polite thing to do.

My cousin, however, is upset that I got my godson a “cheap” gift. I’m a lot more well-off than they are financially so yes, I could’ve gotten him something very fancy and expensive, but I thought that was rude and showing off that I have more money than Mom and Dad. My cousin apparently thought that I would know to get him something of at least the same value as the LEGO set, not less.

My godson loved both gifts and was very grateful, FWIW. But am I the asshole for spending less than his parents?I was recently awarded a MAJOR scholarship. Like, life-changing, actually gonna let me go into college without a significant amount of debt. Part of this scholarship has an award banquet a few months from now that I'm allowed to bring three guests with. 

I have no idea who is gonna be coming with me. I've even considered the idea of bringing no one and just going alone. My family is definitely an option, but for many reasons I don't wish to bring them along, My family has told me in every step of my high school life that my decisions were wrong. You can't go out for soccer cause you don't have a good enough physique, band is too expensive so you need to quit, robotics takes too much time out of your life and we need you at home. Telling family "thanks for the input but I'm doing these things regardless" proved to be one of the best decisions of my life, and participating in all these things was the main reason I was able to get this scholarship.

Most importantly, my mother is telling me "you're bringing A person, B person, and me along".  While A person I have nothing wrong with and she never told me I was wrong in my choices, she was never necessarily there for me either. B person was one of the major people telling me I should quit, and my mom is a whole other story of abusive behavior and manipulation into doing what SHE wanted to do, not what I wanted, along with only showing up to events in my school where parents got recognition. 

I'm too busy to sit down and pick right away, but I vaguely have in mind a few other people, none of them being family members, and one of these people is my boyfriend's mother, who has been a major supporter in my high school life. She is there to reach out for me when I need support, lots of hugs, lots of putting up with my unique situation. At the same time, she scolds me as if I'm her child for all the dumb things I do, as well as offering guidance in the process of becoming an adult. She has provided endless rides for me which allowed me to keep participating, and gone so far out of her way to help me when she never had to. None of these things my family ever did for me. I haven't asked my boyfriend's input on this situation yet as to how he think she would react to me asking her, but I plan on doing so as soon as I figure out whether or not I want her there most.

My mom already doesn't like boyfriend's mom namely because I think so fondly of her, and I worry how my mom will react in specific. I'm going to pick my guests based on who is the most important, not based on who I'm the most upset with, but if it comes down to it and my family isn't on the list, then what? Do I rework my choices for them so I don't disappoint or how do I tell them that I'm picking the family of my friends over them for this event, when they already hold so much resentment that I'm more attached to them than my birth family?Pretty self explanatory for like the basics, but also there are smaller details.

&#x200B;

First off, I (22) have stopped going to college (Art major), I have my personal reasons, mainly tying in to mental health, for this and I plan on going back. I have PTSD and really bad depression that can lead to some dark things and college holds a big trigger for me and just in general large amounts of stress. So I've been taking time off for myself and am doing much better! Like so much better and okay for the first time in years. I think my family expected me to get okay and then rush back off but I'm taking more time to make sure I'm genuinely stable. I'd also like to take time so I can focus on repairing relationships and build a really good foundation for myself but to my family thats crazy. They're not the best when it comes to the idea of taking care of yourself. Its very much a "suck it up" and "walk it off" culture for them. The relationship between my family has always been pretty strained.

&#x200B;

My big problem is with my grandma. Shes kind of batshit insane but ya know with my family thats whatever. Shes very obsessive and controlling and wants everything to be perfect, I think she has OCD just because of her tendencies and the fact that her son (my step-dad) has it. But she would never get diagnosed for it, let alone help for it, because no one in my family really believes in that stuff. She absolutely adores my brothers and then it comes to me and she just tears me a new one over things that I "should" be doing. Its always been ridiculous like I got a 90 on an essay instead of a 100, or my brother did something and I should've done something to where they shouldn't have been able to do that, to even that I'm not doing enough.We had a recent phone call about some degree plans she sent me (vet tech and nursing) and it ended up being a nasty spit that I know shes still mad about and I'm still hurt over.

&#x200B;

I am a lesbian, and that has been a problem for a while. My mom and step-dad are coming to terms with it and I guess my grandma has been "fine" with it but there is the typical talk about everyone elses relationship but mine type of thing going on. Which I don't love but its okay. However, I have to absolutely never mention it around my grandma's side of the family because she knows they would stop coming around. Which has happened to me with quite a few family members on my mom's side but she never told me to hide it. My grandma seems really ashamed of it so if her side (we call them the Arkansas Family) comes around I don't show up. And they are coming for this birthday party so....

&#x200B;

Tdlr; My grandma belittles me often, the homophobic side of the family that I have to go back in the closet is coming over and I just don't want to be around it but I feel bad bc the dude could die at any moment hes so old. Would I be an asshole to not go or to just run in say happy birthday and run out?My boyfriend made a post previously but left out some details that I think is important to the issue. 
&nbsp;   

I’m currently 19 weeks pregnant and temporarily staying at a relative’s place because I have really horrible anxiety around people and my boyfriend has 3 other housemates. Sounds pathetic but I wouldn’t even go to the bathroom when his housemates are out in the common areas. I’m over at his place most days of the week and leave with him when he goes to work. However, it is understood that I’d have to move in with him at some point.
&nbsp;  

On Monday, he called to tell me that I was going to have to get used to someone new living at his place because he was letting his friend move in with him. His friend has schizophrenia and sent him some worrying messages so he flew him over to Sydney. He mentioned that his friend would be sleeping in his room when I’m not there and in the living room when I go over. This means that we’d be spending most of our time together with him as well (yes, it’s selfish of me for not liking the idea) since we usually spend ALL of our time in the room. I didn’t react badly but I was noticeably unhappy about the situation as I went quiet for a bit. He told me I was in no position to be unhappy and to “sort it out”. Later on, I explained that I understood why he had to help but I wasn’t happy with how he approached the issue with me when we could have discussed about it calmly. He told me not to go over anymore if I didn’t like it. 
&nbsp;  

He made it sound like I threw a fit over the whole thing when I’ve only been civil throughout. He asked me what my issue was and I explained. My concerns about the situation are the length of the arrangement and the fact that he hasn’t seen this friend in 15 years or barely talked to him.
&nbsp;  

So he called me selfish and cold for being unhappy about the situation and the discussion never progressed any further until today. I admit that I do lack empathy at times and I honestly don’t know why. 
&nbsp;  

My view is that I understood why he did what he did but it doesn’t mean I have to be happy about the situation. I had no intention of telling him to kick his friend out either. AITA?I have 3 daughters, E (11), L (9, 10 in 3 months), and V (5). For E’s birthday, we decided to take her and a couple of friends out into the city and take them to the zoo/hang out in the park. My wife would take V to one of the children’s museums nearby so that she wouldn’t annoy the older girls. 
Since E and L are so close in age, they have some mutual friends so E allowed L to come with her. I guess at school leading up to the weekend L mentioned that she was going to a party and one of her classmates, O, asked if she could come. L asked E, I guess E said yeah. The only problem is that they forgot to tell me. 
So come party day, I’m rounding everyone up, we’re basically out the door to head to the train station when O and her mom show up. Me and my wife are apologetic, but we refuse to take O along with us even as the mom is walking away. We manage to convince her to take her kid back, and we leave. It was a great day. 
When we got back home, we saw that O’s mom had texted in the parents group chat for L’s class telling them what had happened. Everyone seemed shocked and said that we were in the wrong, but we don’t think that we did anything wrong. Aita?

Quick Edit: There were 3 other girls besides my daughters going to the zoo, we had worked it out with their parents in advance where we would pay half of their train and zoo tickets and full price for dinner. It was just my wife and V going to the museum, and it was L who told O about the party.I work at a creative agency - part of a larger multinational group, but our office only has about 25 people in it and we are divided into 3 seperate teams. It's pretty laid back office and with a very casual vibe because it's a lot of young-ish people and we're all about keeping things informal for the most part.

Like its totally normal for us to say things like 'fuck this' or 'shit that' or even 'cunt', even when you're with clients because everyone in the industry understands i guess that this is how people speak, and it's fine to be candid with each other. And i've never had any issues with it.

However, recently we got a guy seconded from Chicago to come work in our office. He was very cool initially, had a confidence and a charisma that's different to what we normally get in our city so people liked him. However he would just throw the n-word around like whenever. As an exclamation, as a title...literally whenever.  And at me. And I am not Black. \[EDIT #1, I'm not White\]

&#x200B;

I guess most people didn't say anything because he was Black and the only Black guy in the office (it's very multicultural, but he was the only Black person). But he would say it to me whenever like "n\*\*ga, what's up these reports?" or "dayum, Ni\*\*a you looking fresh", or things like "Nig\*\*, are you for real with this?".  Anyway, I really didn't like it and I could tell he enjoyed the fact that I'd wince or get thrown off everytime he said to me.

On Monday, i had enough. We had a disagreement on a brief and he didn't like the proposed draft I sent to the client and he said "what the fuck was it you was thinking, my Ni\*\*gga??"

Now bare in mind, I was already stressed about the brief and if you're going to question me, at least do it in a way that isn't so callous.

So after he said that, i lost it and I was like "Stop calling me that, MY N\*\*GA".

We then had a pretty heated argument in the meeting room which went a bit like

"bruh, you can't say that to me""Well i was quoting you bro and  you need to stop saying that shit around the office"

"what the fuck do you care how i speak?"

"because you're talking to me this way"

etc. etc.

Basically, we had to be separated, and I put a formal HR complaint against him. He's been temporarily suspended for the week while they look into the incident and the conduct leading to the disagreement, but basically my co-workers are mad at me because they think i instigated it and then over reacted. I think I was in the right because frankly him throwing that word around was just weird and inappropriate. So AITA?This happened several years ago, but my mother and grandmother still bring this up.

I live alone with my mother, (no father), and my grandmother takes the role of the “other parent” most of the time, but she doesn’t live here. Everyday when my mother comes home, (around 6-10 pm) she’ll come upstairs to where my room is and come in and say hi immediately. If I’m in the shower or something, she’ll come up and go “Oh! I love you! Haha!” and go into her room.

One day though, it was different. The day beforehand I had seen a lump in her bed that looked exactly like somebody was sleeping in it, and when I asked, nobody else was supposed to be in the house. This was... me being paranoid, obviously, but it’s what caused me to freak out so bad. The next day, I was in the middle of taking a shower when I heard the front door open. I assumed it was my mom, but.... I didn’t hear her come up, nor did I hear her say anything. I remember that I had left the door unlocked, and then I texted my mother to ask if she just came in, and called for her out loud.

She didn’t answer. Well, now I’m freaked out, thinking somebody has stepped into my house, and I’m naked and afraid in the bathroom. So I texted my grandmother that I thought someone was in the house and that I was hiding in the bathroom, and then sat there in fear for a while.

My grandmother did eventually come, and, it was actually my mother who had come in. (She texted me this.) They asked me to come downstairs to talk, but it took me around 30 minutes to gain my composure to. My mother acted very passive aggressive and hurt towards me, and my grandmother said “You need to apologize.” So I did. My mom seemed mad at me still and went outside to smoke, and I went and cried in my room.

I don’t think this was really fair, though? In my mind, I would have really appreciated it if she had reassured me it was her once my grandma talked to her, and helped ease my nerves. But maybe I was being an asshole for being so paranoid?

AITA for thinking my mom was an intruder and calling my grandmother to come over?

EDIT: Since somebody mentioned it.... My mother and grandmother tend to bring this up as a, “christ you need to lighten up a little, paranoid” story whenever I talk about moving out and putting up a camera by my door for security. My mom also tends to bring it up when I ask her to quit leaving the door unlocked at night.Title maybe sounds a bit bitchy but anyway. 

EDIT: Just to clarify guys, I don't want to publicly shame her and I don't think she's being deliberately awful at all! Other than this she's actually really sweet, it's just become more constant lately and that's led to me feeling more and more frustrated. 

I (22F) really struggle with disordered eating, and I've been going through a particularly bad restrictive phase the last few months. Not looking for any particular help w that, that's a whole other thing to work through. 

Basically what you need to know is as a result I eat a really low cal diet and obsess about calories, so my meals are work consist almost exclusively of either salad or fruit and yogurt. The girl I sit next to has decided for herself that I'm like super healthy and won't stop mentioning it. 

Every time I decline a snack or show up at my desk with my salad she comments on how 'good' I am, as in: 'Oh aren't you being good today?' and other things to that extent. I almost snapped today bc I declined some brownies she'd brought - I was already in the middle of an anxiety attack bc I had to buy the wrong kind of yogurt for lunch - and she said 'aren't you well behaved, are you on the diet game too?' really loudly.

So my question is WIBTA if I told her about my eating disorder to make her stop? Is there a way I can tell her without it looking like I'm trying to make her feel bad? Or should I just keep my mouth shut and deal?Sorry for poor formatting, I’m on mobile. 

I (F25) currently live with my boyfriend (M28) and his parents while we find somewhere for us and our dogs to live. 
Per our unspoken agreement, he pays rent/utilities, I take care of our food, we share our dates/trips. 

I used to keep very few groceries in the house and we would mainly order takeout for dinner as I get off work late and never want to cook. Recently I realized I really do enjoy cooking and we should start saving, so i started to stock up on staples and spend more time cooking at home, meaning I’m making breakfast and lunch there and most of the time dinner. She always comes into the kitchen to make comments when I’m cooking, usually a really heavily toned, “oh, you’re cooking again?” With a little bit of a nasty emphasis on again. I try to not let this bother me and brush it off but lately I’ve noticed the groceries I buy dwindling rapidly. 
Sometimes she doesn’t even wait until a couple days have passed after I go grocery shopping to eat everything. 

I had noticed when I first moved in that if I left things in the kitchen for more than a couple of days they would be partially eaten or all gone by the time I got around to wanting them. I figured that’s just what happens with families living together but it’s just gotten above and beyond now. I’m not a stingy person and I don’t mind sharing but she has to have some sort of binge eating disorder as she will finish entire boxes and bags of things the same day I get them. I buy ice cream bars, I get maybe 1 and the rest get eaten, she doesn’t even leave the last one. My family came to visit from a different country and brought me a big block of my Favourite cheese, this would normally last me at least 2 weeks, it was all gone by the time I went to have some, it cannot be replaced in this country. She finishes whole family sized bags of chips before I get to open them. She ate through 3 bags of peppermint bark, that were a Christmas gift, before I got one piece. I really don’t want to look like a bad person but I cannot keep feeding her at this level. Boyfriend told me to start hiding stuff in our room if I really wanted it/thought she would eat it, he said she’s been like this his entire life. I don’t want to keep things in our room as I’m scared of bugs and his dog gets into and eats everything. 

My mum suggested buying a lock box for the kitchen but I think that comes off as quite rude. 

His mum and I got into an argument over something else over the weekend and she said it isn’t her fault that everything I buy gets eaten, I told her to grow up and leave me alone...
AITA?**My side of the story:**

This is an argument I continue to have with my gf. I have been with my gf for about 7 years now. She gets upset that I don’t mention our relationship to certain friends. The friends I omit the relationship are religious. I DO mention her to other nonreligious friends and mostly everyone else we meet.

Context: I grew up in a Muslim culture and for a long time became estranged with many of my friends after turning atheist. I am slowly getting reacquainted with some of them and haven’t told all of them that I am atheist because I guess I haven’t assessed where we stand, how much they care etc. Since in Islamic culture having a girlfriend is considered ‘haram’ I don’t tell them about her or the relationship because of a few pragmatic/non-pragmatic reasons: fear they would stop being my friend, the word would get around, to protect my family’s ‘reputation’ in the community (my dad goes there and it is his only social outlet), friends parents telling them to cease hanging out with me etc. For these reasons I figured it’s just more convenient to omit the whole relationship. I have noticed other Muslim friends that have gf’s in the community do the same. 

My gf seems to think I should just be upfront with all of them about *everything* in my life (atheism, relationship, etc). I told her it’s not that simple and some friends (I consider them more acquaintances than anything) I don’t want knowing so much about my life. I prefer to keep some people at arm’s length and don’t hang out often with them. She refuses to budge an inch on this matter and I feel she’s being unreasonable.

So AITA here or what?

Edit: Yes, I would tell them all if I was married as marriage is more culturally acceptable.

Edit: I have explained to her the cultural aspect, but she gets angry every time I do so, calls me a coward, dishonest etc. She mentions I am atheist so it shouldn’t matter, I tell her it still does because of lingering ties.

Edit: I told my gf before how she has lost all ties with her family/culture for mentioning me and that isn’t an option for me atm. 

**Edit GF’s side of the story for perspective:**

>”Guys, I'm the gf and here's my side of the story. We've actually been together for almost EIGHT years and my boyfriend will literally omit me from EVERYTHING when speaking to his acquaintances.

>For example, he has this one friend who he hangs out with a few times a year and the other day, I drove him to his brother's house so he could hang out while I went out to hang out and do some stuff myself. 7+ hours later, I texted him to ask him when he would be done hanging out so we could head home since it was 9pm and our home is an hour away. He responded and said he didn't know how to tell his friend he had to go, so I then waited for another TWO hours until finally he said his friend was leaving (all of this because he apparently just couldn't tell his friend that I was WAITING FOR HIM OUTSIDE) and then turns out his friend was in the same parking lot as me and he hadn't left yet so my boyfriend was upset that he may have potentially seen him getting into the car with me. AND THIS FRIEND ALREADY KNOWS I EXIST and that my bf has a girlfriend, my bf is the one who wants to sweep my existence under the rug every chance he gets.

>We went traveling together last year for 5 months and every time someone calls him, I'm completely omitted and he acts like he went on a solo trip for months. And the whole reputation thing he mentioned in the post is complete bs, everyone obviously already knows he has a gf, it's no secret, it's only my BF that pretends that's the case and refuses to introduce me to friends and instead makes a concerted effort to remove my existence from all the major events of his life. It's so demeaning listening to him alter the entire story of his life to dis-include me from it.

>Also just for reference, I have always mentioned my bf and stood up for him no matter what to the point where I no longer have ANY relationship with my family at ALL. He's muslim and my parents are from India so I understand the culture pretty well. It just feels horrible (I don't even know how to describe how this makes me feel honestly) to know that I ALWAYS come after the feelings of others whom he's not even close to. /rant”So, a few months ago, my (24M) housemate's (47F), I'll call her Alice, boyfriend, let's call him Cal, temporarily broke up with her and moved out. We had shared an apartment for 3 or 4 years at that point, and during that time Cal had many major blowups, shouted obscenities and death threats over minor events, such as the time he broke a cabinet door because one of our other housemates washed his coffee stirring spoon without permission. Cal has also been known to make disturbing sexual comments about Alice to her daughters (who are both grown now, but apparently were not adults when he started this behavior). 
 Because of these things I feel uncomfortable with having him in the apartment now that he and Alice  are a couple again. The problem with this is that a few weeks ago I was babysitting Alice's  granddaughter, and would be alone at the apartment while doing so. Cal demanded to stop by and see her, but only contacted Alice about it. Because she had arranged the meeting, I asked her to call the meeting off, admittedly because I want no contact with him. 
  In response, Alice told me that I was being childish and selfish, and had no right to keep him from her grandchild, but I don't feel that an unpaid babysitter should be responsible for visitations.
   In the end, the child's mother agreed with me that it is not right to demand visitation without her being home and told him that he couldn't see her because I'm uncomfortable with the situation. To be honest, Alice's words cut deep though, and I'm wondering if I truly am a terrible person for not putting my comfort aside to let him see the child. So, AITA?So my seven-month-old son and I are staying with my husband’s grandma For a month because of an unavoidable situation. In this time, she has found land, bought the land, started packing up her things, and has scheduled for movers cleaners and a showing of her house. 
   
My seven-month-old son and I have been staying here, and listening to her and giving her opinions on what she should do when she asks. I’m not very close with her so I couldn’t possibly go through her things and decide what she wants to keep or not.. anyways, she’s under a lot of stress. She’s just now getting down to the nitty-gritty and I asked her last night if there’s anything I can do to help her. She said that I could pack away DVDs in a box, which I’m doing today. Then, later on in the night her daughter said something about me helping her, and she replied with “She should’ve been helping me this whole time”. It kind of stung, because I didn’t come here by choice and I didn’t even know she was moving out this soon. 


AITA for not helping her out more?

 (Also she’s barely elderly. She has a whole farm that she tends to and she builds her own chicken coops and what not.Last night my roommates girlfriend flew in from the Dominican Republic (I’m on the west coast). She rang the doorbell and it was about 2am and my mom had opened the door. My roommate (25M) was not here and has not been sleeping here for the past month (Hence her suspicions and unexpected arrival). He comes and goes like once a week. Anyway she  comes in and we’re like he’s not here and we don’t know where he is. She stays in his room and waits for him, he gets here about an hour later ( my mom called him and told him about his unexpected guest). 

Anyway I then study/ do hw for a bit and go to bed. I have an evening class ( I normally work during this time but I wasn’t scheduled) so Im excited I can actually sleep in( my phone is on silent bc and I didn’t need an alarm bc today’s my day to sleep as long as I want). I wake up at about 12pm, with 50+ missed calls and texts from my mom. She’s telling me that “roommates girlfriend” missed her flight back and she’s locked outside. I go out into the kitchen and my mom is there pissed that she had to come home during her break and let her in because I was sleeping. The girlfriend made a comment along the lines of “good morning sleepy head or finally sleeping beauty is up” She is a nice girl and we get along but I think it was a genuine mistake and I had no idea. I just want to say that I feel bad she had to be outside and I know I would hate to be in that situation. 

AITA for basically leaving my roommates girlfriend locked outside.BACKROUND

So i live in a house of three children. Me (14M), my older sister (20F) and another sister who is 25 but is not important to the story. Before i start i need to tell you that my sister sometimes has her phone on during breakfast while i mostly never have it.

So this happened yesterday while my sister was at her boyfriends house. My mom,dad and me all sat down to eat and i pulled out my phone to text a friend to ask him when should i come over when my dad out of nowhere yells out:

Dad- PUT YOUR GODDAMN PHONE DOWN FOR GOD'S SAKE

Me-w-what i just pulled it out to text a friend and my si-

I get cut off

Dad-i don't care what you have to say just put down the fucking phone.

I put my phone down and try to ask him

Me-if i can't have my phone on then why can my sister ha-

I get cut off again

Dad- she is something else. You can have it on during breakfast when you finish school completely

Me:but she is still in college

At that point my mom tells me to finish breakfast and leave the room which i do mad as all hell and i didn't leave my room before 3 pm.
So Reddit tell me. AmITheAsshole for having my phone on during beakfast?TLDR: Ex used credits for an airline that she said she'd pay me back for, didn't do so when she used the flight.

I dated a girl, let's call her Katie. We met at church after having both recently moved to a different state but are originally from the same city. Very serendipitous. 

We dated for several months. She is more extroverted than I am, and had friends from college around the country she visited every year. She's moving back to our hometown to go to grad school, and I'll be moving back to work remote for my company \~4 months after

We ended up breaking up for reasons I am still unsure of. A few months before,  purchased flights for us to go to a friends wedding in our hometown. She said she was excited to go and meet my friends.

Turns out she breaks up with me a couple weeks later. No big deal, these things happen. When we broke up she said she was sorry about the charge for the flights but was moving and paying for grad school and said she couldn't pay back. I understood and told her no big deal and I would eat the cost.

I called the airline about a refund (Southwest), and they said that since I had purchased a Get Away ticket I could only get refunded on credit for another flight, and that the credit would go to the person taking the flight, not the purchaser.

I informed my ex and told her to just pay me back when she used the flight. She agreed.

A few months later, I see her post a picture of her in New York with her friends. I'm curious so I call the airline to see if the credit had been used. They inform me that it was used on a flight from the city we were in to New York that weekend.

I message her and ask if she used the flight, she responded, " I actually completely forgot about this but I’ll let you know if I use it!"

AITA for commenting on her post, "Looks like a fun time, pay me back when you get the chance!" or should I have messaged her letting her know I knew she used it privately?TL;DR: guy at work ignores fridge policy, and managers say I’m supposed to throw out his food even though it’s not unhygienic/mouldy.

So I (21m) work in a large international big-box retailer, specifically in the internal food department. The organisations supports workers eating cheap and health at work, and facilitates this with a ‘coworker restaurant’, where people can eat for cheap. I regularly work in the coworker restaurant.

I have a coworker (mid 40’s M) who works in a different department and puts his lunch (brought from home) in the communal fridge. His son died last year, and though his antisocial behaviour existed beforehand, nobody has called him out in ages.

All food in the communal fridge is to be labeled with a “day dot”, identifying when it was put in there. One of my responsibilities is discarding any unlabelled or expired food (hourly) as I find it. My managers regularly reprimand people for not doing so, even if the unlabelled food is from that day. I’ve informed this coworker on 2 occasions, both occasions he was standoffish and rude, saying “well why don’t you mark it, what’re you getting paid to do in here?” Which is fair, however everyone else takes care of their food, and my list of responsibilities is long.

He continues to refuse to day dot his lunch, and while I don’t want him to go without lunch, I also don’t wanna get reprimanded when the managers check. WIBTA if I start throwing his food out?

EDIT: It is not one of my responsibilities to label people's food, signage on the fridge outlines it falls to each person to take care of their own food.I, [F32] am dating a great guy, Alex, [M33], and have been for the past year. Things have been going great up until a few weeks ago, and I’d like some outsider opinions on this, lest I mess up a good thing when I’m the one in the wrong.

Alex and I recently attended a birthday party for a mutual friend, Ellen, where we ran into an ex-best friend of mine, Lila.

Now, I realize how petty and elementary school ‘ex-best friend’ sounds, but that’s literally the situation at hand. Lila and I met through Ellen about maybe two or three years ago, and were as close as could be. However, I then discovered she’d been trying to seduce my boyfriend at the time, (we’ve since broken up) among other things. (Taking my stuff, lying, and spreading rumors about me through our friend group.) Since then, I’ve distanced myself from Lila and said friend group. 

Anyway, so I ran into her at the party, and tried to ignore her, giving Alex a condensed version of the story. Maybe thirty, forty minutes later I left to use the restroom, and came back to see them talking. Obviously, I was irritated, but let them finish their conversation to avoid seeming petty, or like a helicopter girlfriend.

When they were done and she’d walked away, I pulled Alex aside and asked him what was going on. He said that Lila seemed really nice, and that she must’ve changed or been going through a rough patch when I was friends with her. He told me that she invited him to a party she was throwing, and that he thinks we should go. My reaction was all shades of WTF, and while I let it rest at the party, we argued about it upon coming home.

He says we should go, I vehemently disagree. Any opinions would be majorly helpful. Thanks!My husband will be moving to another state to go to school. His grandmother raised him and she is a packrat borderline hoarder. Being raised by someone like that he too has those behaviors. He saves EVERYTHING.

I have told him I’m going to rent out a dumpster and throw away anything he doesn’t deem important. If it’s that important he can take it with him when he moves or move it to a certain spot in the house that way I know not to toss it. 

Our house is a raging dumpster fire with random stuff. I can’t stand it anymore. We have a little one who will be crawling soon and I don’t was her to be getting into anything that could hurt her. 

AITA for telling my husband I’m going to be “cleaning house” with all the crap in it? 

Note: anything sentimental or of value within reason I’m cool with. Like he can have his own things but this is ridiculous. Empty cardboard boxes, 12 pack boxes, old mail (mostly junk), old clothes that haven’t fit in a decade, some of his ex’s things as well as her kids things. I’ve lived with all of this for the last three years and I’m at my wits end.I’m a freshman currently living in on campus apartment style housing. 4 bed 2 bath and 4 people. One of my roommates (I’ll call O) I moved with from a bad previous dorm situation. One of the girls is seldom around, so it’s usually just three of us.

The girl (I’ll call W) who I’m sharing a bathroom with is awful. I have pictures of all the messes she leaves. 

Messes like:

Leaves all of her unrinsed dirty dishes in the sink to the point no one else can do their dishes. It smells.

W has a large red trash (only SHE uses it) can she keeps in the living area that, most recently, she filled that up entirely, filled up another full sized trash bag next to it, then filled up 4-5 grocery bags with trash and left it out for weeks. It smelled so bad and now we have flies. O finally got tired of it and took it out.

W is very loud, at all hours. Loud sex, TV at full volume on her laptop, Her and her boyfriend always talking and laughing really loudly too late. Cooking at 2-3 am?

Her boyfriend basically lives with us. He maybe goes 2 days max not at our apartment. It makes me so uncomfortable because he uses our shower every day. I have no problem with her bf coming over, hell, mine does. However, my boyfriend comes down 2 weekends a month max. Her boyfriend has his own place off campus that they could go to. I didn’t sign a contract to live with a guy.

The three of us have already brought this to W’s attention. We made a chore schedule on the fridge to track when people did stuff and what we needed to do (trash, vacuum, dishes, etc.). And for the entire semester, she didn’t do ONE THING, and she was the one the making messes. Yes, she had agreed to the chore list.

Two weeks ago, W drained her fish tank into our shower, and left the small gravel pieces at the bottom and clogged it???

She’s broken just about every rule we signed in our University roommate contract.

these include:
1) thermostat turned way above what we agreed upon
2)loud way past quiet hours
3)uses our stuff without asking
4) has guests over for more than 3 consecutive days

Neither O nor I are confrontational, and feel guilty every time we want to have a serious sit down with her. We mention it all the time, so It’s not like we haven’t tried. Every time we’ve asked for a group meeting, she ignores us, or gives us excuses.

Two nights ago, O put her clothes in the washer, went to her room to get detergent, and then W took her dry clothes from the washer, and asked O “hey can I move these?” And got seriously offended when O said she was using the washer and to put her clothes down. 

Unfortunately, this isn’t so straightforward. I really want to go to an RA, but with all the rules she’s breaking, the breach of the roommate agreement, plus having unlabeled alcohol (she’s 21 were 18) in the apartment, W could face some serious consequences. 

So, WIBTA if I give my roommate an ultimatum to stop her disgusting behavior or we will report her to an RA and get the Univ. involved?I have an autistic friend who lives in a really intolerant area, so people think he's scum for existing. His brothers don't know it, but they're hateful against him, too. He just texted me tonight, "I honestly can't form human bonds. I dislike most people too much. Most I can do is be a good friend. Yet I was best friends with my cat after 5 seconds. I just want to live off the grid with him."

I told him that isn't normal, and that he should talk to a psychiatrist. He said it's perfectly normal, and I told him that he might be antisocial if he can't form human bonds. He said, "If I open up to you, it isn't an invitation to psychoanalyze me." The conversation moved on from that, but I'm wondering if I'm TA. I really think it's a red flag if he can't bond with people romantically. He's said weird stuff before like how he dislikes most men even though he's a guy.Would I be the asshole for not inviting my grandma to my baby shower? (This is her first great grand baby) 
I do not want to invite my grandmother on my fathers side and here are some reasons why.
 We have never been close, whenever I’m around her she makes sure to get me alone and then asks me completely inappropriate questions(are you and __ having sex? Do you use protection, etc) she once showed up to my house and stood outside knocking on the door for over half an hour..that was after I told her I was busy and did not want to hang out with her. The list could go on. I have had her blocked on Facebook for about a year now because I do not want her knowing any of my business. I have talked to her in person about why I do not want to continue our relationship and how uncomfortable she makes me. She broke down saying she apologizes, will change, blah blah blah. I still stood my ground since she has never changed and I just do not enjoy being around her. Now fast forward, my dad is absolutely furious that I won’t invite her to my baby shower. I told him that it is my day and it would be ruined if she was there. He called me selfish, telling me that even though she has done all the things I’ve listed, that she is family so I need to still do the right thing and invite her. He doesn’t understand my side at all. I also just found out she’s been using my deceased grandfathers Facebook to spy on my page since I don’t have him blocked.In the past 2 years I’ve struggled with disordered eating (think eating around 1000kcal a day, purging food etc,) and I’ve been trying to recover since I came to college. My girlfriend (who knows about this) has just started a diet, which is fine by me. However, she talks about calories in food and how she avoids certain things bc they’re “high calorie”. I thought this wasn’t having an impact on me but I’ve realised I’ve started restricting again and counting my calories and I think it’s because of her talking about her diet. WIBTA if I asked her not to discuss specifics of her diet with me as I find it bad for my mental health? She’s a lovely girl and I know she wouldn’t do this on purpose but I’m trying hard to recover and I don’t want this to cause a downward spiral. Thanks for reading!!I've been living with my housemates for about the past 4 years.  
About 16 months ago, we moved into a new 3 bedroom apartment, with 2 allocated car spots and a storage cage.  
I don't have a problem with that, because I don't own a car and my 2 housemates do.  
When we moved in, we agreed to split the rent based on each room, mine being the cheapest due to it being the smallest, the next housemate is with the largest room and a balcony, and the highest is paid by the housemate with an en-suite.  
The difference in rent between myself and the highest rent is about $30 or $40 per week.  
However after a while, I felt that the rent was disproportionate, due to the fact that they also have access to a car space, which I don't use or need.  
Based on the average going rate, people who have an extra space usually rent it out for about $40/wk.  
When I told them that, they looked at me like I was crazy, and was demanding too much.  
They told me that if I get a car and find a space to rent, they're prepared to split the cost.  
However I feel like they should be paying for their own space, and if in the future I need a spot, I'll pay for it myself, even if it costs more than the average 40.  
Am I The Asshole for wanting to pay $26.66 ( (40/3)x2 ) less rent per week?So I live with 4  other people. Parking situation is occasionally problematic. This is made more so by the fact that my broken down car is sitting in one of the parking spaces. I'm driving a car my dad loaned me for the time being.

The problem is my roommate (and her ex) feel that she(the ex) is entitled to a spot in the driveway instead of on the street about once a week. This means that after a long ass day, I get home at 9PM and have to hunt for parking because there's  no room in the driveway and street parking is scarce(but there probably would have been plenty earlier in the day.)

When I am tired the last thing I want to do is drive up and down side streets looking for parking, especially knowing I will have to get up the following morning and walk all the way to my car to leave for work. Yet when I've tried parking behind said roommate/ex, even in a way that would give them some room  to wiggle their cars out, they complained that they would not be able to get out. They both work the night/afternoon shift, so the days that they leave the house before I do are few and far between.

I dont think that guests of the house should be entitled to a spot particularly when it's easier to find parking in the afternoon/early evening when they arrive, but I worry if I say something about it they'll just bring up my other car. AITA if I say fuck it park behind them anyway?I'm a college-level programming TA. For some people, programming comes naturally; for others, the logical approach is counter-intuitive to the way their brains naturally work, requiring a lot of effort to rebuild thought patterns to think in logical terms. This course has one of the highest fail rates at my institution, so I hold extra office hours for students who need additional support. I truly believe that \*ANYONE\* *can* learn to program if they are committed to it.

This term I have a student ("Dan") who seems to be really trying. He comes to almost all my sessions, tells me he has watched YouTube videos etc. but is still struggling to understanding the most basic concepts like variables and mathematical operations - what programming is built on. I try to work with him on as much as possible, but I also have other students so I don't get as much time with him as I'd like.

For context, Dan is the first in his family to rise from poverty and attend college. He made it through our infamously horrible K-12 school district. I recognize that that is a large factor contributing to his current struggles. Additionally, Dan does not have many resources available to him such as the luxury of being able to quit work/miss shifts to focus on school or attend extra sessions. Knowing this, we often give him extensions on homework assignments etc. However, this has created a rolling "debt" where Dan is always behind and playing catch up. Based on my experience, it would take an INCREDIBLE comeback at this point to receive a passing grade. Today was the midterm practical exam and Dan barely got past setting up the basic main function and declaring a few irrelevant variables. Next week, we are starting the "hard stuff" and I just don't see how Dan will ever be able to catch up. However, I see that a lot so why is this different?

Well, Dan's story is inspiring to me and I want to champion for him and encourage him to stick it out and try for success. However, Dan is dumping so much of his time and energy into this course that his performance in other courses is suffering hard. At this rate, I worry that he will not only fail this course but the others as well. Whereas, if I was honest with him, it might not be too late to redirect his energy from this course back into his other classes and recover his grade enough to pass them. Then again, who am I to say what someone is capable of? However, I think if I were him I would want someone to be real with me.

So Reddit: WIBTA? Or, is there maybe a way I can demonstrate the steepness of the upcoming hill in this class so that he could come to the conclusion himself?

I love my job, I hate my job.Alrighty, this is on mobile, a throwaway, names and minor details have been changed for privacy concerns, etc. 

During freshmen year at university, I bonded with three other students. Thomas and Rex were my housemates as well, so it was nice. Thomas’ girlfriend, Danielle, had her own dorm, but it was close to Laura. However, by the end of freshman year, Laura was kidnapped, and we lost all contact with her, and we are quite frankly, unsure if she’s alive or not at this stage and time.

We’re juniors now, and I mentioned in front of a bunch of my friends (it’s a larger group now, but I’m still closest to Thomas, Rex and Danielle), that I want to request that the university leave a chair out for Laura’s memory during graduation. Thomas, Rex and Danielle were really excited about it, and agreed, but a few others called me an asshole for it, and said that I need to get over it, and that besides, she was technically an enrolled student who could come back. [The university froze her account instead of withdrawing her], and that graduation was about a time of celebration, not bringing up miserable shit.

tl;dr friend got kidnapped, my close friends and i want to leave a chair out for her, others disagree.

Realistically speaking, I don’t see her returning, but I get where they’re coming from. So... are my friends and I the assholes for wanting to have a chair out?I live in a small appartment where the kitchen is connected to the living room area. One of my roomate sets up the kitchen table every day like it is her office space after her classes. She is always at the table when I get home but I dont mind at all. She said she likes working there because she doesnt get much work done in her bedroom. 

However, when I get home and use the living room TV for video games or a movies she gets visibly upset and starts slamming her laptop closed and gathering her books and huffs back to her bedroom.

Am I the asshole for wanting to use my TV in the living room at the end of the day? If the roles were reversed, like they have been with my old roomates, I  would just go to a coffee shop, campus, the library, or use the desk in my room.I am the ED of a tiny nonprofit (staff of less than 5) and have a friendly relationship with all my staff. I know ppl like to say their staff is a “family” but in this case bc of how small our staff is, we really are close and have friendly personal relationships with each other. One particular staff member of mine I feel like if they didn’t work for me, perhaps we would have even been friends outside of work.

The issue comes now that this particular employee has been doing the bare minimum for the past 2-3 months. A month ago I put them on a performance improvement plan and they HAVE improved in those specific named duties.

However, while they are still improving I am picking up all the additional work and it has been causing me a great deal of stress and anxiety. We are in our “busy” season and my capacity is already pretty limited. I also am attempting to leave our nonprofit and part of my hiring them was with the intention to develop them to become a leader within this org. It is clear that more leadership/duties would not be a good fit for this person and while they’re improving, I am still spending a significant amount of time doing things to pull them up to the quality of work I want to see (editing emails, managing relationships, re-doing work, etc.)

I am at the point where I think what would be best for them (since it feels they are over their head) and the org, is to move forward and end the professional relationship with this person.

Said person has a significant twitter platform and I have seen them use it to “call out” or shame people before, while I’m less concerned with that, I also wish that we could maintain a friendly relationship.

I plan to give this person a generous severance package (a month of pay and benefits), but I know that they will see the termination as unfair and feel angry/resentful toward me.

I have been having issues sleep, waking up in cold sweats, and headaches for the past week at the thought of having to handle this situation. I am an extremely conflict adverse person and the anxiety is so high that I am now reconsidering and trying to figure out if with more investment and training could we make this work. 

I know that this person has some significant life challenges and terminating their employment would cause them a great deal of personal stress and financial setback. I am concerned about “ruining” their life and being perceived as the AH for not working more to get them to a place of competency. 

WIBTA if I cut my losses and terminated this person or do I owe it to them to give them more time to improve?My parents got divorced when I was 10. By the time I was 14 both of them had found new partners. My mother found a single dude and got married to him, while my father found a single mother with 2 kids. Both my parents pushed the fact that we should treat their partners and in father's case his partner's kids as family members. I was very much against that but I rolled with it as best as I could until I was able to live away from them.

Now, I have been living on my own with a long term girlfriend of mine. We don't want to get married but we wanted to have a kid together and she's now pregnant. While delivering the news to my parents I told them that I would prefer that this was something shared by the family only and by that I meant my mother, father and my 2 sisters. 

This piece of information was not well received, even by my two sisters who were very vocal about me excluding our other "siblings" who would all be very happy with the news. I explained that my kid would not grow up treating the others like family because they were not my family. They were my parent's family and that had nothing to do with me. 

My parents have been trying to change my mind about this because they feel like going along with it would be a slap on everyone's faces and it was unfair of me to put them in such position. While speaking with my girlfriend she says I'm free to deal with my family in any way I see fit but I should probably back down on this and give it more thought.So long story short. Parents in law are getting up there. Father in law should have retired like 4 years ago. They had four kids, two if which were unexpected. They both work he's an electrician and she's a desk jockey. They're too nice, and they have allowed some of my husband's brothers live with them like WAY longer than they should. Like one of them just moved out at age 30 and wasn't paying for anything. My husband and I are well off and we both moved out at 18. 

I believe they have credit debt, and I think they only have a few grand saved for retirement (less than 20k) and her 401k. They also have a house that they have a small mortgage on. They bought it for like 100k forever ago. 

If they need help, they would probably live with us. We make way more money than all his brothers combined. And though we would, of course, invite them, we want kids in a few years and would like our privacy. I think they could rent out their house for like 4k a month and live off the rent in an apartment pretty much anywhere. But we both feel awkward asking them directly about their finances so we were thinking of getting them a financial advisor. But we don't want to insult them either. 

So WIBTA?I've been dating a girlfriend named kirsten for a year now. Everything has been gret except for the issue of me calling her by the wrong name

I have a sister named kristen, I'm very close to her and interact with her often. Before dating Kirsten I was in a relationship with a girl named kristen for 5 years. The name kristen is extraordinarily deeply engrained in my name.

I've tried everything to stop calling Kirsten kristen by accident but nothing working well enough. I'd say I get her name right about 95% of the time. Its starting to take a toll on our otherwise great relationship. She thinks it's a huge deal, I dont think it is, it's not like I'm thinking about my ex or sister when I'm with her, my brain is just used to saying kristen.Background: I (28F) am the oldest of myself and my 7 sisters (we'll call them Jill, Mary, Ruth, Elle, Jane, Nora, Kylie), but all of us are roughly a year apart. Our mom died when I was young, our dad left, and we were raised by our grandmother. A year ago, she was diagnosed with cancer and Mary moved back in to care for her. 

Two weeks ago, she passed away. Mary had called me a few days beforehand to say that she was in decline, so I took a leave of absence from work and returned home. When she died, I agreed to stay in the country to help plan the funeral and handle legalities with her estate.

In our grandma's will, her inheritance was divided very evenly. She had left the house to Mary, which we all agreed was more than fair. Although the house was Mary's, she left the divvying up of the furniture to my sisters and I. We agreed to go through the house and put post-it's with our name on it on the furniture we wanted. More than one post-it, we would duke it out amongst the two who wanted it. No post-its, it'd be sold at an estate sale. 

I live a fairly nomadic life, so I didn't want much. Since my sisters were claiming pretty much everything else, I decided the two things I wanted was a brooch and a small lamp. The lamp was first in my grandma's nursery, then my mom's, then Kylie and Nora's. 

By the time we had finished stickying everything we wanted, we realized that all 8 of us had claimed the lamp. I told my sisters that it was only fair that I take it, since I only wanted the two things, while the rest of them had essentially taken the whole house. Kylie felt that since it had been "hers" most recently, it should be hers, but Nora felt she had a similar claim. Jane didn't "want much" so she felt deserving of the lamp. Elle wanted it in lieu of a wedding gift from our grandma (who was too poor to buy her one), and Ruth wanted it as furnishing for her new place. Mary thought she deserved it for taking care of gran, and Jill felt it was fair that it go in \*her\* daughter's room. 

I told Kylie, who also wanted the brooch, that she could have it if I got the lamp. She refused. It dissolved into a huge spat, so I went outside to calm down. When I came back in, they had agreed to "table the discussion." We all went to go home, but I sat in my car for a minute and cried about the lamp. It was stupid to cry over, but I was feeling really upset in general at my gran's death and was furious that my sisters hadn't allowed me the one thing. I decided to get it anyways. I put my jacket in my backpack, told Mary I had left it upstairs, went into the bedroom, took out my jacket, put the lamp in it's place, and then went to my hotel without detection.

Today, when my sisters noticed it was gone, they went MENTAL. Nobody is speaking to each other. I'm trying to just keep the lamp secret until my flight home in a few days, but I'm scared I'm causing irreparable damage to my family. But I really just want this lamp.

&#x200B;

AITA for stealing the lamp and refusing to admit it?My wife and I trying to use cash only as much as possible to keep us on a budget. The other day I had to leave for work and had no cash for gas. My 5 year old daughter has a piggy bank with money she’s gotten for birthday gifts and things like that. I’m guilty in the past of borrowing from her without asking, and she has noticed before I’ve been able to put the money back, so I stopped doing that. However, she has gotten very possessive of her money, which I don’t think is good.   


This time I asked her if I could borrow money for gas. She clearly didn’t want to, but I explained that families help each other out and I would pay her back. She pulled out a $10 bill and told me she would give me half. Before I could stop her, she ripped it in half. I explained that is not how bills work, but that I could tape it together and use the whole thing. She finally gave me the other half. I already have paid her back, but she was upset and my wife thinks I just should have used our debit card for gas and not asked our daughter at all. I think it’s important for our daughter to learn to share and how money works. AITA?A couple months ago, I was at a jewelry for personal matters, when the jeweler told me that they offer a simple men's ring for signing up to a rewards program. There were no downsides to signing up so I did, and I got that ring for free. I have no idea what it is made of; it's a featureless grey band, like [this $10 ring on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/TIGRADE-Titanium-Brushed-Wedding-Comfort/dp/B07SRS3DMV?ref_=ast_sto_dp), except mine is shiny and reflective.

I brought the ring home, gave it to my husband like "Hey, look what I got :D" without mentioning *how* I got it or the fact it was free. Hubby was over the moon and has been wearing the ring constantly ever since (he's not a jewelry person, his only other accessory is his wedding ring).

At first, I genuinely didn't realize he believes the ring to be an expensive precious ring I bought as a surprise gift for him, but I figured it out over time. Just last weekend, he was talking with his sister, showing off the ring and telling her how thoughtful and generous I was for buying it - and the sister said she guessed it was white gold. I felt deep shame at that moment, especially as I evaded the conversation when the two of them turned to me to ask me to confirm it's a white gold ring.

I didn't think anything of it at first, like handing a McDonald's toy that I don't want to my husband, only for him to act like it's a wonderful treasure I got him. Now I feel that "coming clean" would be really shameful and it's way too late for that, so I find myself trying to avoid the topic and hope he doesn't realize what's up. Does that make me an asshole? What should I do?Okay, so I have 2 roommates in a 3 bedroom apartment. Rent here is absolutely dirt cheap due to the fact it's in a not so great neighboorhood but I'm a full-time student working a shitty minimum wage job full time in order to pay for school and my living expenses. It's been 3 weeks and he still hasn't paid me. I plan to kick him out tomorrow with a 2 weeks time to gtfo. Edit: At this point I don't even want the money from him I just want him to leave so my younger brother can take his place.

Edit (info): These were 2 people who I put through background checks and interviewed personally. He failed to notify me until 2 days ago that he had crashed his car. This wouldn't have been a big deal had he just told me he was in a rough spot and would have the money by the end of the month. He also promised me today that he would 100% have the money. He has litteraly bought a house but is waiting on the deal to be finalized so we believe he is just fucking us over and wasting our time baiting us with the cash he owes us until he can do a midnight move out. (sorry for word vomit hopefully that makes sense) 

AITA ?Gonna try to keep this as short as possible.  My partner and I recently purchased a second hand-tamed budgie with the intention of trying to fully train him to become completely tame (we avoid taking him out of the cage completely because we have not gotten his wings clipped yet)  Our first budgie was pretty much a failed experiment in attempting to hand-rear from a younger age.

To give the new bird a chance to get used to us, we have been keeping him in a smaller cage so we can spend time with him and have said that we want to keep him separate until he gets used to us/the other bird.  More than once though, I've come home to find that he has been shifted into the other cage while myself and my partner have been out of the house, to which she always says "He needs to spend time with the other bird, even if it is little 10-15min "playdates".  "

The issues are:  1. We have had the new bird less than a week and our old bird is very territorial with regards to his cage.  2. Our new bird is learning bad habits from the old bird and is actually becoming LESS tame.  When we first got him, he would quietly sit on our hand.  Now he sits for maybe 5 seconds at most before hopping off again and is almost impossible to catch when we try to remove him from the larger cage.

AITA for starting to get annoyed with my housemate for potentially ruining our new pet by not respecting our requests?Recently I got a gift in the form of a brand new phone. My old phone was still in near perfect condition, and I've been really tight with money for the last couple of weeks, so I decided to sell it online. As I needed the money fast, I put it up for nearly half of what everyone else was asking for this kind of phone and I made sure to put a big "NO REFUND" disclaimer. I ended up selling my phone to a lady about 50 miles away via post, and once she got the phone, this conversation followed:

Lady: Hi! I need your G-mail and password.

Me: Excuse me? what for?

Lady: I can't use the phone without it, see? (she sent a picture of the screen)

Me: Huh, give me a moment please, I'll see what I can do about it.

I had no idea why this was happening as I did a factory reset (wiped all the data) on the phone. So I did some research, and it turns out that at some point google implemented FRP (factory reset protection). What that essentially means is that if you have FRP turned on (and it's turned on by default) and you do a factory reset you will have to sign in with your G-mail account to use the phone again.

This was obviously an oversight on my part and I had to take responsibility for it, so I continued our earlier conversation:

Me: I'm terribly sorry for this inconvenience. Google implemented this new security measure that I wasn't aware of, and that's why it is asking for my G-mail. The only thing I can do for you is have you send the phone back, I'll fix the issue, and send it back to you again. I'll pay for shipping.

Lady: Why can't you just give me your G-mail?

Me: Well that's my personal G-mail, I can't trust anyone with it, especially not someone I don't even know.

Lady: Then I want a refund.

Me: I'm sorry, I can't give you a refund. I realize this is inconvenient, but I'm offering to fix the problem out of my pocket, and you can have a working phone within 2-3 days. Not to mention you're not going to find a better price for a phone like this.

Lady: No. You sold me a broken phone and I want my money back.

Me: Well I'm sorry. The phone's not broken and I'm not giving you back your money. I offered to fix the problem, take it or leave it.

She hasn't replied since.

so, AITA?Throwaway cause my family and friends have account


My mom has her lifelong friend (lets call her F)who's kinda going through a bad phase right now,she has a 9 year old along with a 4 year old.She's been asking my mother for favours such as borrowing our car and taking some money for groceries etc.

Now,F lost all her money doing drugs and her husband left her.He recently passed away so shes struggling making ends meet as she practically lived of his support money(I should add that the younger child was a one night stand and the Father is nowhere to be found)

Recently,F had come over and she began saying that she's going out looking for jobs but needs to find a babysitter for her children.

She guilted my mother into allowing the kids over for some time but now days F has started taking advantage over the fact that she's guilted my mother and has started asking  my mother to ask me to do stuff for her.I was by no means free as I currently had end sem exams going on but I feel bad for the woman so I agreed to get groceries,look after the kids etc

It has come to my knowledge that F has started taking huge amounts of money from My mother as "she needs to make ends meet".We are by no means poor
but we are pretty conservative and since my father's passing a couple of years ago,Mom worked 2 jobs and saved quite a chunk of money for the future.This is rapidly depleting and My mother is just letting her take huge sums of money
Like we can try to help in ways like getting groceries and lending our car but now its getting too much.We recently had to  cancel a europe trip for the two of us    for which my mom had saved for 5 years for.

WIBTA to tell F to stop exploiting my mother for her money? I'm on mobile so please bare with me.

So context: I'm in my last year of university and I'm about to graduate this june. My university held this small contest for those who love writing a chance to write their own speech for graduation day. Those who followed the criteria and wrote the best speech, will win first price $150 dollars.

Now I'm not much of an extrovert or someone who loves to do public speaking, however, a little money to pay for this trimester doesn't hurt, plus with my love for writing and the fact that I have a minor related to it, I decided to go ahead. This was almost two months ago. Well a week ago, they decided the winner a lo and behold it was me! I actually won out of like 80 or so students who participated.

Well here is the thing. Each department has their own "club" with a president, vp, treasurer etc. There is this girl well known by the department of my major and she is known to hold activities and festivities related to our department. From what I heard, she is intelligent and hard working. 

I was speaking to my favorite professor and dropped the news about me doing the speech at my graduation. She congratulates me. I didn't notice that the people from the "club" were there. The professor mentions how the president needs to make a last minute speech for a visitor that was going to speak in one of her classes. I said that I was willing to help her in constructing the paper. The president, however, wanted me to actually DO the speech for her and give it to her in a specific time. She gave me her number and email all too quickly. And to be honest she was very snarky about it.

I told her I was willing to help but that I was against doing the entire speech for her. I explained that I am a possessive person when it comes to original work and that it wouldn't be fair to give someone else my work that they will claim as theirs (I said this as nice as possible). By then the rest of her g̶r̶o̶u̶p̶i̶e̶ club were listening. There is this one girl who said that it's just for a 5 minute speech. I told her I understand but if it's for such a quick speech why demand for help?

They basically said I was being petty and that she was very busy being president. I said that that's her choice as being president and that I am also a very busy person. Again, they kept saying it's just a paper for a 5-10 minute speech. I told the president that why is she acting so entitled and that I wonder who else has made your speeches since you're so busy.

At that moment the professor chimed in. The rest of the group mumbled some nonsense and the president leaves. I felt ganged upon and what stings is that the professor thought I overreacted. So reddit, did I really overreact? In my opinion, it's basically plagiarism. I don't know why are they so ok and comfortable about a student taking credit on another student's work. Just because it's not for a grade doesn't make it any less ethical. I feel like my reputation has been tarnished a bit.So Jane was a friend from HS and retail. Goes to college in a different state. Comes back during the breaks to work. She had been going through a lot at the time (scammed by her second job and one of our friends taking a LONG time to pay back a several hundred dollars). I was there for her the entire time meeting with her etc. Then out of nowhere she mentions she has lice and that it's the second time in less than a year.

I asked if it's okay for her to be out esp with her hair down since it's very long. She said it's fine & that lice isn't contagious unless you share a hat or comb all the time. I wasn't the one with experience so I believed her (like an absolute fool). Especially after her rant about how she worked at a boba shop near her campus and they shared hats and no one caught it for her. So I ignored it and hooked her up with a job at a bakery I used to work at.

Two weeks later & we're plan to eat with some friends we made at the store we used to work at. I asked her if she got rid of the lice and she did honestly tell me that it's still there, but assures me it's fine. My spidey senses go off and I bug her about it until she started getting annoyed with me so I let her be while half jokingly stating that if she gave me lice that I'd never speak to her again so she should really be sure before coming out.

It's the day of the meet up. She comes late because of a shift at the bakery. I see her with her hair loose and out. Since I worked at the bakery before, I know you HAVE to tie up your hair and bring your own hat for hygiene purposes. That meant she took it off and let down her hair despite knowing she has lice. I think this might just be a habit, but I notice she leans in very close everytime she talks and I try to move away without being over the top rude about it.

So the VERY next day I see a louse in my hair and panic as a full adult getting lice for the first time would. Almost have a Britney moment and in my fit of panicked rage I message her saying that I warned her what would happen if she gave me lice and proceeded to block her on every platform. Was this a juvenile move? Yes. But I keep my word.

Tbh, I was less upset about getting lice from her and more upset about the fact that she knew she had lice, knew it was contagious, told me otherwise, and had the audacity to come out anyways. Somehow I was the only one who got it so it may have seem like I was overreacting to the others. What sent me over the edge was that the others were asking if I was sure I got it from her and how I knew so quickly. They were convinced that I MUST have gotten it a week or two ago from the time I met with her one-on-one. I didn't feel like I should be the one defending myself so I didn't although in retrospect that may have put me in a worse light.

This whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth and now I'm left wondering if it was actually my fault, since I knew and I didn't have to go to the reunion/meet up if I was thAt concerned. AITA?I(19f) and my friend "Ella" are going to a big beauty convention next week.

The convention is on Friday and Saturday and originally Ella and I wanted to buy tickets for Friday but they were sold out so we had to take the Saturday ones. By now all the tickets are sold out.

The instagram page of this beauty convention hosted a giveaway last week and the price was two tickets for the convention on Friday.

To enter the giveaway you had to follow the page and tag a friend. I tagged Ella.

Thousands of people entered the giveaway but lo and behold, I won. Since I was already going with Ella to the convention on Saturday, I figured it would be okay to take another friend of mine with me on Friday.

When I told Ella she was very mad and told me that I hurt her feelings because she thought that since I tagged her I would take her in case in I won.

So AITA for taking another friend instead of Ella with my Friday ticket?I was out to lunch with my 5 month old son and he needed to be changed. 

I went to the restroom but found the men’s didn’t have a changing table, so went to the women’s. 

I walked in and there were some hushed whispers from a couple women (wouldn’t have guessed it was about me if it weren’t for what happened next.) but everyone else just went about their business. 

I was sorting through the diaper bag getting everything I needed ready to go when a restaurant hostess approached me and said “oh sorry sir, the men’s is actually at the other end.” 

I explained there was no changing table there and she said “never the less, this is the women’s room, and your presence is making some of our patrons uncomfortable.” 

I was kind of flummoxed and said “I’m fully clothed, I’m not peeking under stalls, I just want to change my son and finish my meal.” 

The hostess began to get upset and said “I understand but how about your wife comes and changes him?” And I told her we were there alone. 

We were starting to attract attention in the restroom at this point and one of the women said “I’ve been there with four of my own. I can change him.” The hostess seemed to think that was a suitable compromise but I wasn’t comfortable leaving my baby alone with a stranger to change him. 

I said this and another woman, who I think is one of the ones who complained, said “Then go home and change him at home or lay your changing pad on a counter surface in the men’s bathroom.” A woman with her added “Cisgender men aren’t entitled to violate our space this way. You’re making people uncomfortable, you need to respect that.”

This was the first quiet meal out I’d had since he was born, so I just ignored her and started to change him. The hostess got the manager, a man, who called from the door that I needed to leave. 

I wasn’t about to drive my baby home in a soiled diaper though, so finished up. I'm a 32 yr old woman and my parents are divorced and have been my entire life. Typical deadbeat dad type thing blaming my Mother for everything and saying that she kept him from seeing me. I've seen him maybe a half dozen times in my entire life. He had three or four fully paid trips per year to see me via his job and never used them, well to come see me at least.

\---He's a wife beating alcoholic--

My grandmother died in 2016 very suddenly and I had a cancer scare so I got the whole (holy shit life is short) mindset and decided to reach out to my father, for the third time (every other time has failed), in an attempt to reconcile. He really pissed me off and first because of the blaming my Mother for everything and for some reason I gave him the ultimatum that if he trashed my Mother this entire attempt at a relationship is done. Which he agreed too and complied with, many points for him.

Everything is going fine. I'm thinking maybe we might even be friends.

Last year my Mother (at 61) dies very suddenly. I am the only child of a single parent. I am completely stunned because she was the only one who I knew had my back regardless.

Guess what happens. He comes with the typical sympathy and whining how he regrets everything that happened and he was thinking of their life together and etc. And middle aged man regret.

Anyway I had to go through a bunch of my Moms papers for other things required by X, Y and Z and one of the things is the divorce agreement. Luckily she kept a copy along with a copy of the custody hearing and I read it.

Well....

He didn't want me. Never did.

In the transcript of the hearing he was bragging about marrying his new wife (Bar whore from above) and had his new son, basically his happy new family. Suffice to say my Mom got full custody. I was six years old at the time and I never knew this since you know, she didn't want me to suffer that hurt being that young.

Sooo for this and among other reasons he and I had a fight and haven't spoken since like July. And I decided to cut my losses and that he was dead to me from that point on. It was just easier and less painful.

Anyway, on February 23 he emails me this:

" I’ve been diagnosed with a brain tumor. I have a MRI scheduled for Tuesday AM, and might know more then. Whatever may come to pass, I do want you to know that you were always in my thoughts, and I deeply regret not being a better father to you "

How the fuck do you respond to that? Where was this 30 years ago?

This situation will inevitably include the rest of my family in some kind of effort to get he and I together to reconcile before it's too late and blah blah blah. Because one of my uncles has this weird idea that everyone in a family needs to make nice.

I don't fucking know if I'm crazy or not.

I just want grieve for my mom and move on with my life. I'm too fucking tired for any of this.

Am I the asshole?A little backstory, we've been friends since highschool and we used to hang out every weekend and drink. I(m27)moved away for a while and that's when my drinking got out of control. This was over a year ago and I have since stopped drinking but I never mentioned this to anyone because I find it embarrassing.

Now on to the party, when I got there I told them clearly that I wouldn't be drinking. They were ok with it at first but as the night went on things started getting a little...tense. They kept commenting how I used to be more fun and that I'm acting like an oldman and they even tried to rope my SO into it.(my SO drinks and I'm fine with that) 

So I decided that enough was enough and said that I was going home, it was only around 9:00pm and I had only been there a few hours. Anyway it made things worse because they started saying things loud enough for the other guests to hear, people I barely know. At this point I'm tired and a little pissed off so I left. Now they're saying I'm a bad friend because I didn't want to drink with them??? So AITA for not drinking and not telling them why? I feel a little guilty but I don't know. I don't think they would understand because when I tell them I don't like it anymore they look at me like I'm insane and say things like I'm still young and I should party while I have the chance.I live within walking distance of a Smoothie King and love getting smoothies all the time. However, I have noticed that a few times when I have tried to get one right after they are scheduled to open that they were in fact not yet open, and I was unable to buy a smoothie. In those instances, I just left and came back later. So this weekend, I was looking to get a smoothie right after they opened and called the place up to make sure that they were open, so I wouldn’t run into this issue (someone answered the phone and indicted that they were open). 

When I got off the phone, my roommate told me that I was an asshole for doing that. He said that he has worked in fast food service before and that he hated getting those calls and that no one working there cared. I said that I would think the business would care because I am just trying to make sure that I can spend my money to purchase their product. He conceded that that might be true of the business as a whole but not of the workers there. And that because I have never worked a fast food service job that I just didn’t understand. 

So AITA for calling Smoothie King five minutes after they are scheduled to open to find out if they are actually open so that I can go buy a smoothie?My boyfriend is upset because I have refused *multiple times* to drive 5 hrs round trip *in one day* for his best friend's baby's first birthday. He asked me multiple times on separate occasions over many weeks what my weekend looks like and I have said the same thing every time: I am getting my car worked on friday, wedding dress shopping Saturday (will not be relaxing for so many reasons), and I would like the other days to do whatever the hell I want (relax, do a hobby, actually clean the house, see my family). He says that we were at my best friend's baby shower for 9 hours last week so what's the difference? The difference is that she only lives 1 hr away and I was throwing that baby shower for her so I needed to set up and break down.

 I am an overworked RN and I need my time off. I'm new to my career and I am struggling with the mental and emotional work required to care for sick people. I clocked 60 hours in just 4 days. Sitting in a car for 5 hours, just to sit and make small talk with people I'm not super close with or dont even know is the absolute last thing I want to do when I'm at my best....let alone when I'm burned out. I have a big smile on all day while I get cursed out by drug addicts, wipe ass, and pray I'm not missing something important for that really sick patient. There is nothing left for small talk. I was ridiculously sleep deprived and burned out for the baby shower last week and started to spiral in a really negative way (as privately as possible). He knows this. There are some friends you can be your 100% self around, whatever state you're in at that moment. His friends aren't those people to me.  Why would I want to put myself in a position where I'm gonna be in an ugly mood around them and dampen their happy day on  top of it? 

So, AITA?Tonight I ordered empanadas from Postmates, and my driver accidentally gave me someone else's order. 

I get it. Mistakes happen. But this time there could have been real consequences for me.

I'm allergic to shellfish. The restaurant I ordered from sells shrimp empanadas that happen to look the same on the outside as many other non-shrimp empanadas. (I can eat food prepared in a place with shellfish). I had no reason to believe my order was incorrect, so I went to take a bite of my food, before I noticed the word "shrimp" written in small letters on the little paper bag it came in. (The overall bag did not have any labels, and they were not obvious on the individual empanada bags). I immediately stopped and checked the other empanadas, and realized I had the entirely wrong order.

I'm sure the driver had no way of knowing what was in the bag or that I was allergic to shellfish, and I don't want to get him fired. But at the same time, I think he should have been more careful. What if next time someone actually does have an allergic reaction? 

This just happened now so I can't tell if I actually want to make a big deal of this or if I'm just fired up from almost having a severe allergic reaction within the hour.

WIBTA if I made a big deal to Postmates about this?I have 2 kids (7 and 3). I stay at home, study online FT, and have moved from my hometown to my partners to be closer to his family, so don't have my own family or friends around for support (his family don't contact me unless I make the effort). So, I'm fairly lonely at times, plus the 2 kids (one with special needs) keep me busy. My partner works long hours, and I appreciate what he does. I make him lunch everyday, don't ask for help with the housework, and keep things in order at home so he literally can just come home, eat and relax. However, he always fails to tell me if he is working late (which is seemingly everyday) which is frustrating, as I plan dinner and the kids activities around when daddy will be home for dinner so we can eat and be a family. I'll call him when I think he should be on the way home so I can organise things to be ready for him as soon as he walks through the door, and he'll often still be at work, or on the toilet at work (😳). He claims he is too busy to let me know, but I see him active on Facebook. Is it too much to ask to let me know of he will be home or not? I feel so invisible and unimportant. I get that he works hard and long hours, but I'm busy at home also with the kids and I get so mad that I don't even get  courtesy text saying if he will be home or not! I prioritize everything around him at the end of the day, and I know that I can just stop doing so, but I want the kids to have a family meal + family time if possible. AITA for just wanting a freaking text and getting pissed when I don't? 

TLDR, partner never tells me if he is working late...So this is something that happened some weeks ago but it was recently brought up again and I never even thought about it but now I man starting to think I might be TA .

So basically I (14 m) have a friend we'll call Emma (14 f). She has had crush on me for two years and I have always known it but never been interested. I just wouldn't mention it around her and we would just hang out like everything was normal. We were pretty good friends and I was just hoping she would eventually just get over her crush on me.

Then one time we were at our friends place (who I will call J) with a bunch of friends talking about crushes and such, and I say something along the lines of "Aww man, I have like 20 crushes haha." And nobody reacted weirdly at all. I didn't think about this because its a pretty normal thing to say.

Maybe a week we are talking and she admits she has a crush on me and she mentions that when I said this she was a bit hurt and I, not knowing what to say, just go "oh yeah haha that was a joke heh." Because I was panicking. Well, later in the conversation I told her I wasn't looking for a relationship and she left. It got a bit awkward but it was okay, and I still considered her a good friend.  (This was about two weeks ago.)

Well, today one of my friends gave me a letter. It was from Emma and she basically just said a bunch of shit that isn't really relevant to this story, but she also mentioned "That time at J's place" and that that was a really shitty and awful thing and that it made her realise that I was a shit person. Well I was reading the letter and I didn't know what "that time at J's place" meant, so I went to her and asked her. She said that talking about having crushes on lots of people in front of someone you know likes you is an awful thing to do, and she told me to have basic respect for peoples feelings. I also found out that some of my friends agree with Emma.

Tldr: I talk about having crushes on lots of people in front of a friend that I know likes me and she tells me I don't have basic respect for peoples feelings.

Edit: I'm asking whether or not I am the asshole for talking about having crushes on lots of people in front of my friend who I knew had a crush on me.Context: I met Jack & his partner Ryan about a year ago when they moved to my city via two other friends of mine, Mike & Sean. The five of us are pretty good friends (Mike, Sean and I are especially close) and we hang out quite often.

Next month is my birthday. I’ve decided I want to have a “Bad Movie Night” at my place. I’ll be providing alcohol and weed for my guests, with everyone free to bring whatever they wish.

My place is small (studio with a separate kitchen) and can reasonably fit about a dozen people before it gets too claustrophobic. Because of this, and the fact that I have several other good friends I’ve been wanting to invite, I decided not to invite Jack & Ryan.

The reason: Ryan has a drinking problem. On any night I’ve been out with him, he always gets the most drunk. This wouldn’t be a problem if this also didn’t come with a 50/50 shot of him being belligerent. While he hasn’t done this to me, he has a habit of saying hurtful or inflammatory things while under the influence. Even when he’s sober he’s been known to be petty when he’s in a bad mood, which is often.

Putting it blankly, he drinks to cope, and he doesn’t know what his limits are.

Ryan doesn’t like being called out on this and can’t really handle criticism either, so if I told him about any of this he would just shut down and likely be petty around me.

I told Mike and Sean about my decision and only them because I trust them and they’ve known Ryan a lot longer than I have; they support my decision. Mike in particular told me not to worry about it and he understood.

Still, I can’t help but feel like I’m being an exclusionary asshole. I was intentionally excluded a lot from social gatherings as a kid/teen and I hated it and now I’m doing the same thing to someone else as an adult. To exclude a friend, even if other people support my decision, just feels petty and immature.

So, am I being an asshole? Thank you.
My (26F) and my fiance (30M) have been together since 2011 and we have been engaged for 4 years now. We are planning for a wedding in my hometown Tijuana in the summer and honestly I lowkey dreading it. I love my family, I grew up in Mexico and I am a proud Chicana and when I was 7 years old my parents moved the family to Tampa.

Now, while Tijuana hosts many many tourists and fun seekers, we do have a close knit community and this is where it starts. My fiance is British with a mix of Senegal, but more apparent on his Senegalese side. My late grandfather is from Gabon to my dad (who is American) and my mom is fully Mexican. When they got married, my uncles and aunts weren’t too happy about it but they let it slide at the time. 

I have two younger siblings and they’re all over the US - we are close and Ill be the first one to marry in the family. I went back to Tijuana a couple weeks ago and this is the first time they met my fiance and I could tell my aunts and uncles were not so welcoming. I mean they do, but you can tell it seemed forced. 

We still had a good time, good drinks, we got everything ready and booked. I wanted to have this wedding here because many of my families cant really travel to FL. And we plan to have another wedding in the UK for Christmas for his side of the family. On the last day before we were supposed to fly back, we had one last family dinner - everything went well until I heard one of my aunts whispering to my cousin (14F) to not “bring another black” to marry when she grows up.

This pissed me off and I said; “do you forget my grandfather is from Gabon and we are “black” too?” Obviously everyone heard this and some took her side by saying I was disrespectful towards her and she’s only saying that to her daughter so it’s “none of our business”.

My parents got annoyed, but tried to diffuse the situation and tried to calm me down. I was about to let go until my uncle chimed in and said “they’re all the same, thats why she’s marrying this guy (pointing to my already uncomfortable fiance) instead.” At this point, I was livid and stormed out and flew back the next day. My fiance werent that bothered and my family said I should let it go. 

Fast forward to yesterday when they reached out to apologize. it seemed half assed apologies and said “you of all people should understand how hard it is for our people where you are.” That statement made me even angrier and I said to her “its because of people like you with this fucked up mindset is why we have this issue in the first place.” I hung up and refused to have them in our wedding.

When the word got out that I uninvited them to my wedding my phone blew up and said I’m being ridiculous and unreasonable for uninviting my own family to my wedding. I said its my wedding and I can do what I want & they all start labelling me as Bridezilla. My family and fiance took my side and they agree its my decision. This whole situation is divided and now some took my side and some took their side. So my question is, am I the asshole?My boyfriend has very nice parents however they are Mormon, not extremely strictly, but sometimes this makes them pretty judgmental of other people. I don’t think it equates necessarily to their religion but my BFs parents can be kind of oblivious to how rude their judgment is at times and will poke fun at people or have a “holy-er than tho” appearance. Not so much his mom but more so his dad. My BF and I have gotten into disagreements before about how I feel judged being a pretty liberal person around his conservative parents and usually I have to hide a lot of things about myself (my septum piercing, tattoos etc) and never go too deep into conversation regarding politics. 

Anyway I wasn’t too sure where to have my graduation party. I didn’t necessarily want to have it where I live (with my mom and her BF) because the house is a wreck from my moms BF spending the last two years “fixing it”. So there’s like open ceiling, old flooring that’s all cracked etc, a whole room he demolished to be redone but only had gotten the wooden structure back up in two years. Her BF has a company and the office is attached to the house and that segment of the house is way nicer. I told my mom if we did have a graduation party this May then we should either have it at a park and just grill out or in his backyard and only let people use the office side of the house for a restroom etc. 

My BFS parents are way more wealthy and better off than me. They offered to have the party at their house, their big backyard with its own fishing pond etc. It seems like a lovely gesture but I don’t necessarily want to be so concerned about their rules. My family is not very religious like them and they drink, smoke, etc. His family doesn’t even believe in drinking coffee or tea do even I have to hide that. I know for a fact my family will want to have alcohol eat the party, maybe even beer pong when it gets later and the acquaintances leave since this is what they did for my highschool grad party years ago. Basically his parents are pretty offended I don’t want to have the party there because I told them point blank there will be alcohol and other things they don’t approve of. They weren’t like pissed off but we’re still mad and hurt. My BF isn’t religious like them and understands my choice but I feel rude to pass up a nice party location just for the fact that I don’t want to have to follow their strict rules. 

AITA?I've been dealing with depression and anxiety pretty much all my life. I tell my close friends about this issue, if anything related comes up. Past year I had to spend more than 6 months lying down due to an illness I suffered, which also caused chronic pain. It was one of the most difficult times in my life, and still I'm both physically and mentally trying to recover. During this period, a friend of mine, lets call her Becky, had been calling me regularly and cheering me up. I've been so grateful for her support so when she needed it, I wanted to be there for her.

Now, Becky is a very enthusiastic but an aggressive person. She makes plans and if anything comes up to ruin them, she goes berserk. Swearing, ranting, getting angry is her style. In the end, everything works out, but her behavior causes a lot of unneeded drama.

Last year Becky got engaged. Ever since she wanted the wedding to happen as soon as possible, even though she and her fiance are in no place to support themselves and start a family. In her quest she changed jobs, forced both families to invest in their marriage. With her new job, Becky had to deal with new stresses, and realized that her new field of work is too demanding for her to create the married life she wanted. She fought with her boss a lot, and started having anxiety and panic attacks. As someone familiar with this type of situation, I always recommended her to see a professional and told her I was there for her. But I ended up being her sounding board. Our daily conversations of support turned into her calling me five times a day, at least for 30 minutes, crying and venting her anger towards her unmet plans.

After days of persuasion, she finally saw a psychiatrist, who prescribed her medicines to help with her anxiety. The very same week, she quit her job and quit taking her pills, started acting over-the-top fine considering her state in past 3-4 months. I didn't realize her anger and continuous venting had triggered my own anxiety, and suddenly I found myself trying to cope with my returning demons. I told her I've been having a hard time and since she's doing fine, she should tone down the anger she's venting on me, but it didn't help much. After a couple of warnings, I had to take a more stern stance and told her that I gave her all the support I can and to stop calling me for a while until I can manage my anxiety. She screamed and shouted, saying how hard it was to deal with her upcoming wedding, how she was fighting with everyone and she even came to the point of breaking up with her fiance. I told her everyone has a life and everyone has problems to deal with, and right now I can't be there for her. I haven't spoken to her ever since, and I don't plan to in the near future. And if she keeps up the same aggressiveness, I don't even plan to reconnect with her again.

I desperately tried to remove myself from this stressful situation, but I feel that as a friend I could've handled it better.

AITA?This is my first ever post so sorry if it’s bad. 

So I’m in a construction class and the class has to do projects. My friend and I were working together to make this project. About 1/2-3/4 way through our project someone in our class forced himself into the group (we didn’t mind too much since he just needed someone to work with). But the whole time he was in our group he didn’t help do anything. My friend and I thought we did a great job on the project so we kicked the guy out before we got it marked so he didn’t get our mark for doing nothing. He did get into another group so he didn’t just get a zero on the project.

AITA for kicking this guy out right before the teacher wanted to mark the projects?

(If I could do anything better, as in the post, not the story, please tell me)Hey guys. Let me start by saying this happened about 4 years ago, I was 18. I had just broken up with my first long time girlfriend. In my loneliness, I went on a chatroom that I liked to frequent, and met a girl named k. K and I became very good friends, we were the same age and she had just broken up with her first boyfriend, and we bonded on both being heartbroken and yadda yadda. I was just glad I had someone to talk to again. After a month or so of us knowing each other, we started kind of being mildly flirtatious with each other. This would usually happen very late at night over Skype. One night, it was very late and I was feeling horny and stupid. I remember we were playing a game of Truth or Dare (I know I know). The dares eventually became the removal of clothing. I would dare her to take something off and she would dare me. However, she seemed kind of ... Shy about it? Like I wouldn't say uncomfortable, but maybe embarrassed? She did tell me to remove clothing, but it would take a while for her to say it. I also remember the video quality was awful so it was hard to read how she was feeling. Eventually we were both nude and we still wanted to play but she didn't know what to dare me. So I suggested I could show her my penis, to what she agreed (although again she seemed shy). I did, and she just kinda said "wow okay that just happened", and things kind of ended there. I remember on my turn, I wanted to see something of hers, and she said she didn't want to so I didn't push. After that incredibly awkward night, we both kind of realized that we wouldn't work out like that I think. The flirting became less and less and we kind of just became friends. We eventually stopped talking to each other, and I haven't heard from her in a long time. She never expressed any anger or discomfort about that night to me verbally, in fact the next day she just kinda shrugged it off. Was this an example of an awkward teenage sexual encounter, or was I being predatory? In hindsight, I wish I never did it, but at the time, I figured she was telling me she wanted to do these things, so she must have wanted me to? I could see now how it could almost be grooming, and I feel kind of gross about it all these years later.*On mobile, sorry for format

Background:

I watch my Kindergarten aged niece 5 days a week after she gets out of school. M-Th 6-8 hours and F I actually drive 15-20 min to pick her up and bring her home to watch her for anywhere from 4-7 hrs. 

I get paid $60/wk to do this. If it is a short week, she will even drop it to $40. Per my sister's request, I will pick her up other days as needed. Sister brings lunch for niece 2-3 times a week. I provide the other days. 

My niece is only alone, without another child type of alone, for 2-3 hours and my son (like her brother) gets home. I have a playroom, art room, Lego room, and plenty of movies, educational games, etc. 

My sister constantly brings up my niece's complaints of me not entertaining her.

Story:
Today my sister asked if I could take niece to a bounce house, alone, without my son or her other daughter, so she could "have something to do". I felt this was a ridiculous request as she would NEVER do this. Hell, she has yelled at me for taking my own child somewhere without her kids.

Sister says she is "helping me out" by even paying me what she does and that it is my job. I say that I provide plenty of activities for her and the short amount of time she has unstructured play is good for her. I also say its not my job to be her constant entertainment. I do play board games or color, etc. every day with her. Just not the entire time she is alone.

Edit for clarification: She is NEVER alone. She is just without another child to play with for 2-3 hours. I do play with her. Just not for the entire time before we pick up my son.

So AITA?Edited for formatting (damn phones) 

Context basically boils down to: me being a potwash in a moderately busy restaurant with a temporary head chef sorting rotas.


TLDR I'm tired of my rota getting changed last minute WIBTA for telling people to stop changing my hours to suit their needs

Last Sunday I got the rota, great I can make plans around this. Head chef asks me mid shift Sunday if I would be alright working some extra hours IF NEEDED today I agree saying along as the rota is changed before hand.

I look last night before bed (11:30ish) no change cool I can watch some movies I've been meaning to catch up on. 20 minutes ago and boom I get a message asking where I am cause I agreed to the hours which I guess I technically did(?)

I'm new to the whole kitchen lifestyle of work and don't really understand if what is happening to me is common or I'm getting messed around unfairly.I (F35) have been told my entire life by doctors i would never be able to have kids. So imagine my surprise when i have a one night stand with my boss (M50) and i get pregnant. I found out i was pregnant a month ago. We had our one night stand in the first week of october. I was overjoyed and finally felt complete. I am currently about 20 weeks and my boss found out yesterday when he came back from a sabbatical he took for 2 months. He’s MAD. He tells me i have to get rid of it. I then found out he had a wife and a whole entire family which i NEVER knew about. (btw i work at a private law firm and he owns it with his brother) He says he can’t have a child with me and even after i explained to him my fertility issues he said i have to get rid of it. In our area i could technically get an abortion right now. I told him i’m not getting rid of it and he’s saying i ruined his life. We used a condom, he’s the only man i’ve slept with in the past 5 years. All my exes have left me because i cannot get pregnant so to me this is a miracle. In our area he would be required to pay child support, no matter what. I want this baby and i think i’m gonna keep it. He’s saying i’m ruining his life. I even recently found out it was a baby girl. My sister is on my side but her husband spent the better part of yesterday reaming me for forcing him to have a child. My boss is saying i’m gonna ruin his family and his kids life. So, AITA for keeping my baby?My dad and mom were together for 26 years, but my mom separated from my dad a year and a half ago because she didn’t want to deal with mental health issues (relevant later). 

My dad is still desperately in love with my mom, and he is working every day to get better. However, my mom has found another guy who I’ll call Steve. They’ve been dating around a year. There’s nothing wrong with Steve, and I have no personal beef with him, but I’m not close to him by any stretch of the imagination. 

I’m getting married, and my dream wedding always included my dad walking me down the aisle. I sent RSVPs out last week. My mom asked me to bring a plus one to our wedding, and I confirmed that plus one would be Steve. 

I texted my dad to warn him that Steve will be at the wedding, and I got no answer from him. He called me a day later and told me that he cannot attend my wedding. He fears that he will have a relapse into alcohol if he sees my mom with anyone else. 

I texted my mom and told her Steve can’t come because I want my dad to be there more than anything in the world. She was understanding, but told me her relationship with Steve is on the rocks because he feels like he will never get to fully be a part of her family because of my dad. She says she will choose me, but she will never have a relationship with any man if I keep “choosing” my dad. 

The way I see it, I’m not choosing my dad over her, I’m choosing his sobriety over Steve. And while I understand Steve’s concerns, I don’t think he can expect to fully integrate into an established, adult family. I feel like Steve is guilt tripping my mom to go to a wedding for someone he barely knows. Am I looking at this wrong, or is Steve overstepping?Weird story I know, but bare with me.

My (37M) son (15M) is very skinny and therefore very sensitive about his weight. Wife (36F) and I have been giving him weight gain diets, occassionally made home-made protein shakes for him and he's slowly making progress, but it's a long way. He's committed to make himself normal again and that's brilliant.

We visited my family (a couple of states away) again for 2 weeks, after not seeing them for 2 years. It was a nice reunion, until my son complained that Uncle (40M) was complaining about his weight and how fine he used to look before and how he looks "similar to a twig". I had a chat with him and told him that this is a sensitive subject for him and that it's best that you don't talk about it. I made this clear to everyone in private.

Family dinner, we were eating and Aunt (35F) made kept on making comments about my son not eating enough and told him to enjoy the food and eat. My son was upset and didn't say anything at all. I never said anything too, but later instead told my Mom (the only person who actually listened to me) that we'd be leaving a week early because I didn't like the way my son was being treated by Uncle and Aunt. She was disappointed but respected my decision.

Uncle and Aunt heard us and begged for us to stay longer and that they never knew that he was THIS sensitive about it. I told them perhaps they should have thought about that before commenting on my son's weight for the entire week. And so we went back home and here we are. Friends say that I'm perhaps being too sensitive about their jabs at my son's weight and I think I am starting to see why. AITA?I employ a cleaning lady who clean my flat every Saturday mornings. It used to be this old lady who eventually couldn’t work due to health reasons and therefore recommended her niece Tessa. Niece Tessa doesn’t do as thorough of a job but it’s passable.

Come last weekend before I was going to go out of country. I was up and about the entire time to ensure she did the cleaning well, whilst packing. 

The night before, I wore a pair of cluster diamond earrings that were given to me as a present by my parents last year. I placed them back in a tiny secure box as I usually do after a late night and put them on my bedside. I remember thoroughly putting them inside the box because I hate wearing anything on my ears in bed (I’m easily overly sensitive). 

I came home days after, wanted to wear them again and realized they weren’t in the box. Though I had vivid memories of returning them I started to question my memory. I talked to my sister who often drops by my place to house sit when I’m away if she borrowed them (she hardly borrows my things to be fair and when she does she never fails to ask).

So my sister then revealed that the reason why she doesn’t bring her valuables over was because the last time she did, she lost an expensive bottle of perfume and this was while Tess was cleaning. She also mentioned one time Tess was asking for an “advance” last November (my sister failed to reply and didn’t lend her money).

I also remembered losing a sapphire necklace while she was cleaning—that I left in the pocket of my gym tights—but have chalked it up to irresponsibility.

So I called the old lady asking her for her help to just check if Tessa brought anything home. By this time, I figured despite anyone grilling Tessa whether she did it or not, I wasn’t likely to recover the pair. So I just gave Old Lady the facts and told her I’m not blaming anyone, but it’s lost and if she could check. Old Lady was very angry at Tess as we’ve had a good relationship—I pay her and her niece’s a day’s rate plus lunch for a 3 hour job at most. 

I went to work and later in the day got a barrage of texts from Tess—blocks of 5-8 consecutive messages at this point. Mostly saying she would never do such thing, how my blaming her has made her lost her dignity, then peppered with thank you for constantly helping her, that if I would want to talk... 

I honestly don’t know what to think. I just feel bad for having to terminate the services knowing (1) I have no proof, (2) she needs the money, and (3) though she doesn’t do a thorough job as I’d like, it’s not like she coasts around and does nothing whilst she’s cleaning. 

Aita?First post! 

So my guy works in a distributing warehouse and in the office there a woman works aswell (she does the admin) and it’s only the 2 of them there and occasionally the owner and his wife come in to check on things. She is fairly new let’s say going on to a year but she started bringing him home cooked meals and if she goes out for a bit to run errands she would bring him back takeaway food. He told me about the first time and I thought it was a nice gesture until it became quite frequent maybe 3 times a week. I let him know that I felt uncomfortable and a bit annoyed with him accepting it all the time especially when he’d finish work and not be hungry or come back with his lunch that I’ve made him and he hasn’t even touched it. Of course he told me that I was over reacting and being dramatic. So I stopped making him food for work and sometimes I eat dinner before he gets home which he isn’t happy about and honestly I don’t care because he should tell her not to bring him food so often but if he wants to eat her food so much then I should just worry about myself. I feel he disregarded my feelings so easily and didn’t see the bigger picture. How would you feel? Would you want it to stop?.Obligatory on mobile statements please excuse errors. DV stands for Disabled Veteran it's the same thing as having a disabled placard. (Fair warning it's a long one).

I (35m) am a disabled veteran I don't advertise I am one but I do have my states DV plates that allows me to park in handicapped spaces. They performed a transfemoral amputation in 06 due to combat-related injuries. So I have an endoskeletal prosthesis, you, however, wouldn't know it was there unless I rolled my pant leg up. You especially wouldn't know from looking at me from the waist up. I also have a babyface when clean-shaven.

This morning I had to go to the nightmare that is wally world (Walmart) and was lucky enough to snag one of the close-up handicap parking spaces. I pull in turn off my car and before I can even do anything this elderly woman and her son pull up behind me and start laying on their horn. They were motioning at me so I thought maybe something was wrong with my vehicle and they were trying to signal me so I got out of my car to check with them. 

They roll down their window and the son starts yelling you can't park there that's illegal if your handicapped person isn't with you you need to move. The mother chimes in with this whole shame on you for using someone else's benefits (not verbatim). I say sir I have every right to park here as I am disabled. I pointed to my DV plates to emphasize this. Then he yells (yelling bc of the motor running I assume) even if you have some disability (that tone where they don't believe you) it's pretty clear you have no issues walking what the fuck ever. His mom adds you're younger than me the right thing to do is for you to give up that spot to someone who REALLY needs it. 

Admittedly my temper was starting to get up so I said. Ma'am, sir if you fucking think I broke the law call the fucking cops I will gladly wait for them to sort this fucking shit out. If you don't want to do that then you can fucking pound sand I got here first so fuck off. I leave and go inside thinking it's over. I'm in the store maybe 20 mins when the woman and her son come up with a Walmart security guard and a cop. And they start interrogating me in the aisle asking if I had accosted the lady and her son. I start trying to tell my side of things but son butts in saying he doesn't look disabled at ALL. 

I'd had enough so jerk up my pant leg so they can see the lower part of my prosthesis and say is this disabled enough? The security guard apologizes but adds well you should have just shown them, to begin with instead of being an AH about it. I was so pissed off I just ended up leaving the store, now that I've calmed down maybe I was the AH here but my wife says I wasn't and that security guard and everyone else was in the wrong.

Edit: for context, the cop never spoke to me I assume he was there to make sure things didn't escalate. After the altercation though as I was walking away the cop spoke to the security guard. For all, I know he gave him a come to Jesus talk.

Edit two: To be fair the lady was using a mobility scooter.

Edit: because it keeps coming up. 1.) In my state, DV can park in handicap spots without the hanging placard. It's a state to state thing.

2.) Some days I do have trouble with walking and pain. There is no way to predict what days I will have PLP (phantom limb pains) walking further distances tends to spike it. Then it can last a few seconds, a few minutes, hours. I also have extreme lower back pain that when it gets bad enough I have to use my cane. These things are never entirely alleviated by the shorter distance but it does help.Ok so I am in high school, and at our school we have an internship program where we get connected to internships around the city. So, I applied for a few internships last April, as a junior, and only heard back from one, which I took. So yesterday, I receive an angry email from the lady in charge of the internship program, lets call her M , saying that because I didn't show up for the first day of the internship, I was putting the school in a bad place and breaking a contract, saying that I "requested the opportunity" and saying that she sent me 8 emails about it. So, apparently, this December, 8 months after I applied, M started emailing me about the program and saying that I was accepted asking me to confirm my acceptance. However, after 3 months of hearing nothing after I applied, I stopped checking my junk box for email from her, which is where all of her 8 emails went in December. When I told her this M said "You made the effort to apply and requested the opportunity. You put us in a compromising position with the employer. Your seat was reserved and the employer committed to you and expected you to be present."

&#x200B;

She also said "your principal is aware that you did not respond to me or the employer. As a student, it is your responsibility to check, verify and communicate with the district and the employers that you applied to directly"

&#x200B;

I'm so scared that I'm going to get in trouble for not showing up, and I need a principal recommendation letter for my scholarships in college. AITA and am I screwed for getting that scholarship?I am 15M. I have two stepbrothers,  16M (Kyle) and 12M (Derek). My mom has been married to Kyle and Derek's dad for 8 years now. Kyle and Derek used to spend every other week here with their Dad.

 Last year their mom got a job in another state Kyle and Derek got to choose if they wanted to go with her or stay with their dad, and they chose to go (Kyle wanted to go because he wanted to live in the big city, and Derek wanted to be with Kyle). They moved last summer, and come back here for school breaks, so they were here for Christmas. And they're coming for Spring Break.

However, my friend invited two of us to go to Portugal with his family during Spring Break - they have a house there. I would only have to pay for my plane ticket. I really want to go. I've never been to Europe or on a trip with friends, and spending a week in Portugal with my two best friends sounds great. 

My mom thinks I should stay home because my brothers are coming and its a chance for us to spend 'family time'. I told her I think its unfair that I have be stuck here and cant go, because my stepbrothers decided to move away. After a couple days she changed her mind (i think my stepdad talked to her) and said I could make my own decision. So I said i'm going. She reminded me that they won't be here again until July, meaning I won't see them until July. I said ok, I still want to go, so she gave in and bought my ticket last weekend. 

Anyway tonight my stepdad was talking to Derek on facetime, and Derek was crying. I asked whats wrong - and he was upset because he found out that im not going to be home for spring break and he wants to see me. I told him Summer will be here soon and I'll see him then. My mom gave me one of those disappointed looks after hearing what was going on. And now Kyle is mad that I didnt tell him myself, that he had to hear from Derek that I'm going away. Which honestly, i think Kyle being mad about anything right now is bullshit. 

it feels like everyone is mad at me right now except my stepdad, but maybe he is as well and is just hiding it. So reddit, am i being an asshole by wanting to go away when my stepbrothers come back for spring break?I started a diet about a month and a half ago.  Keto ftw I’m a Reddit basic bitch (I’m a dude but reddit made me do it).  I’ve been successful and my oldest daughter (16) wanted to join in.   I told her I would *help* her and have given her all the same resources that I have used.  There’s cookbooks, apps, fucking reddit—but you know what I get?  Dad please plan every meal and snack that I put in my mouth and I will put forth no effort at all except to complain about what I can’t eat (because she knows what she *cant* eat but has no idea what she can eat).  She is not a child and knows how to cook and bake and is good at it!!  She used to cook stuff all the time and we’d come home to recipes she’s tried; come home to cookies she’s found a recipe for.  She is in no way dependent on my wife and I as parents to cook or make her meals and she has no problem making whatever she wants when she’s hungry. 

But since joining me on the diet she acts like she has the dumbs.  I’m like I’m happy to make whatever you want—FIND something.  Don’t complain when you do nothing and get stuck with whatever I make.  I’ve meal prepped for the week and she doesn’t want to play any part in it.  So tonight she got served normal dinner (yeah I cook two separate dinners—normal food for my wife and other daughter, the picky ones lol) along with everyone else and complained that she couldn’t eat rice.  It was chicken curry and it was banging by the way per everyone else.  I had my own dinner. 

So, am I the asshole for putting her back on “normal” food because I’m kinda bitter that she just wants to diet but not participate?

Edit:  I’ve decided that I’m a little bit of both from the answers so far.  Me and my daughter have a great relationship and talk all the time, and I think I just need to realize that she still a kid and she has plenty of other stress in her life to worry about meal planning.  If I want more help I should be more inclusive and make her cook with me—or I should stop cooking so damn good lol.Out of our immediate team of \~15 people under my supervisor, there are ladies - Alice, Mary and me. Mary was here long before me, and I've been here almost two years. We have both been subject to sexist remarks about our gender from most of the team, and my supervisor has been particularly er handsy with me and constantly makes comments about what he thinks I'm good for outside of work.

I've put up with it thus far because a) I've been trying to get another job in my field, but I'm not able to find a similar job and b) this job pays really well and provides great benefits. I'm also trying to transfer to a different team in the company but no dice.

So back to the current situation. Alice just joined the team 3 months back, and like me she is also young. Two months in, she pulled me aside to about my experiences with supervisor. And I gave her an abridged version.

Now it turns out that Alice would like to report supervisor and has asked me to support her by also letting HR know what supervisor did to me.  I am not comfortable doing so though, as I would like to keep my job and would rather not talk about everything in great detail (heard that I would need to give exact dates, situations, my reactions etc.). I'm not sure HR would do anything anyway, as some of the comments have been made in front of our HR rep.

I told her that I'm willing to let HR know that I've no reason to believe she is lying, but I think she is scared that it is a he-said-she-said situation and wants me to back her up. Mary apparently is no help as she only experienced the sexism but not the other parts of it.

 Alice and Mary now both think I'm an asshole for betraying women and that I'm as bad as my supervisor, but am I really wrong to want to keep what happened to me private?

AITA?Quick edit to address common questions- 6:45 - 7:15 am is my typical blender operating time, I don’t use any ice in my smoothies, and we do not share any walls, the apartments are separated by a hallway 

So, every morning for breakfast I make a smoothie in my blender. It’s easier, healthier, and faster and tastier than cooking so I much prefer it. It’s a regular old Oster Blender.

We just got a new neighbor in the apartment across the hall. We hadn’t spoken until one morning she intercepts me as I’m leaving for work. She seems like the very fussy type and he talks really fast. She introduces herself and asks me my name and asks if we can talk. I said sure, and she tells me very quickly that my blender is insanely loud every morning and told me I need to stop using it, before I could even say anything or apologize she turns around and walks back inside. 

I’m driving to work and thinking “I’ve been doing this for five years now, and no ones said anything, and it seems pretty quiet even inside”. So after work I decide to test it out. I turn on the blender and walk outside my apartment and close the door and it’s a barely audible hum. I can’t even imagine how much quieter it is after going through another wall, so I decide I’m just gonna keep doing what I’m doing. 

I make my breakfast like normal and two days later as I’m leaving for work she intercepts me again. She asks me why I didn’t listen to her and I explained that I don’t feel the noise is unreasonable and that two days ago I tested it myself and stood in this very spot and could barely hear it, so I can’t imagine how it’s insanely loud in her apartment. 

She starts threatening me that it’s my last chance to listen to her before she goes to management and I tell her that I actually would like management to be involved, this seems like a situation where we need a third party to determine if I’m making an unreasonable amount of noise and if they say I am, I’m happy to stop. This was four days ago and I haven’t heard anything the girl or management. AITA?I’m an American au pair living in a European country. The country I work in only allows au pairs to work a maximum of 25 hours per week, in order to allow time for learning the language and exploring the country, etc. When I was interviewing with my host family, they mentioned that they ask their au pair to work a few extra hours, and in exchange they’re more generous than average with pocket money. It seemed like a good deal, and they seemed like really nice people, so I went with it. 

I’ve been here for a few months now and my standard weekly hours are around 38-42. They do pay me overtime when I exceed that, but I feel like as a baseline that’s way more than the couple extra hours we had discussed, and the money isn’t that much more than average. (For reference, the legal minimum they can pay is €80; I make €125. The other au pairs I know work around 20-25 hours and make €100-120, so even though I do almost double the work I’m not making anything close to double.) 

I’m starting to get really frustrated with the arrangement because I feel like I’m a full-time employee and not an au pair. If they were paying a nanny to work my same hours, they’d be spending thousands per month. I recently brought this up with my host mom and she said she’s willing to talk about it more, but she feels like the rate I’m receiving is “pretty standard” and that we’re “functioning as agreed initially.” But I never agreed to be full time! I thought when they said “a few extra hours” they meant 3 or 5, not nearly 15. 

I have a contract that states the amount that I’m paid and that I am to work 25 hours a week. (They put this because they knew it was the legal maximum and that my visa would get denied if they put more, and also potentially so I wouldn’t realize how much work was actually expected of me until I arrived.) Would I be the asshole for saying that unless they start paying me closer to what they’d have to pay for a full-time nanny, I’m only willing to work my contracted hours?TL:DR long time friend is pissed bc I bought my future SA from a breeder and didn't adopt. I told her to stay in her lane or kick f*cking rocks.

Alright before the pitchforks come out please let me explain.

I (33f) am disabled, I have a lot of mental and some limited medical issues. My doctor, psychiatrist, and therapist have been suggesting for years that I get a SA(service animal) for over a year now to help me be able to rejoin society and live life again. I've considered being on the lists for SA's but decided against it as I feel others have a greater need than I do, the service through them is free and though I can't afford the money to buy one already trained which is around 15k-30k there are still people worse off than myself. So I and my BF (35m) decided to take 3rd option of training a SA ourselves. The main reason why we decided this is bc my BF and his business partner train working dogs. They're actually starting to pick up some small government contracts.

We initially went to a cpl of shelters in our area but decided against the dogs they had for a few reasons and settled on a breeder. Why? Bc the breeder is reputable, we know the temperament of the breed of the SA we are getting, and this particular breeder has had many of it's previous liters become SAs. We found [Hoss](https://ibb.co/2g222cC) who is a Belgian Malinois. We still have to wait a bit to take him home but are super excited so I, of course, shared this news with my friend "A". 

As I was showing A the pic she asked which shelter I was adopting from and I told her we weren't we were getting Hoss from a breeder and explained why. A lost her shit going on a whole rant about how I was contributing to the dog population issues, the puppy mills, and everything else that goes along with that. I tell A that look if I were getting a pet or ESA and not a SA I would adopt but I'm getting a SA it's different. She keot insisting we hadn't looked hard enough. Finally, after back and forth that went on for a while (and why I may be the AH) I threw up my hands and said JFC A I get it I do but you need to stay in your f*cking lane here you don't know anything about SAs or what my specific needs are either accept our decision or kick f*cking rocks. 

A and I haven't talked for a few days, my bf is on my side here but a few mutual friends say I'm being ridiculous over a dog that I need to see her side of it and try harder to find a dog from a shelter.I [19F] love my best friend [20F] to pieces. But, she has a habit of self-diagnosing herself with every mental health disorder known to man. She tells everyone that she is diagnosed with: depression, anxiety, PTSD, bipolar disorder, and OCD, just to name a few. She talks about her different disorders often and asks me for advice on how to lessen their effects on her life. 

One time when she asked me this, I asked when the last time she went to the psychiatrist for a psychiatric evaluation was, and she said that she’s never been to a psychiatrist. When I asked how she got diagnosed with all of these illnesses, she said that she went to the student health services at our university and they "diagnosed" her using questionnaires. When I asked to see the documentation they gave her, she said that she didn't receive any. 

Having diagnosed anxiety and depression myself, I know that diagnosing any mental health disorders is much more complicated than filling out a few questionnaires.

So, Reddit, would I be an asshole for not believing that my friend has all of these mental illnesses until she has legit documentation?

EDIT: For those saying that I’m TA for asking my friend for documentation, I take mental health disorders very seriously and don’t think that terms like PTSD and BPD are ones to be thrown around. Of course I listen to my friend and give her advice on how to deal with her personal issues, but the fact that she is saying that she is diagnosed with all of these illnesses that she is not is the issue. There is no doubt that she has baggage, but I believe that she should be properly diagnosed by a medical professional before she uses these terms.My nan was cooking me chicken drumsticks for dinner when I had to go do a chord that was a lot of hard work my food had a good solid hour left before cooked so I would've been there in time before they were clocked fully. When I got back I found them out so I assumed that they were cooked so I asked her to put them on a plate as she always does when they're cooked. She said they were not cooked so I asked why they were out she said it was do my sister can cook a cake I shout that this is ridiculous. AITASo around September 2017 me and my mother moved to the US, but due to passport issues my father could not join us. 

Now, my childhood was not happy by any means, and neither of my parents are very good people, so when an opportunity came to not talk to one of them ever again, I took it.

Last time I even attempted to call my father was in July 2019, and I don't even think he answered. AITA?For quick clarity: I (20F) am not transgender, and I respect the LGBTQ+ community. I identify biologically as a female, and look very much like one save for short hair and height. 

I decided to change my name at high school graduation to a more unisex name. Now that I’m in college, all of my friends/coworkers/teachers call me as such with no issue. It adds 2 letters to my birth name. That’s all. (For example: Changing Alexandria to just Alex. It’s obviously not quite the same, but it gets the point across) Anyways, My family has put up a huge fight. Some say the name change is ugly, the it adds to my “gender-confusion” (which, again, I’ve expressed multiple times to them I am not transgender), that my preferred name is a boys name only and that my birth name is beautiful and I shouldn’t disrespect my parents. 

So come my birthday, many of family members asked what I wanted, and I said that I want them to use my preferred name. And to make a long story short: they were incredibly upset and blamed ME for ruining MY birthday because I brought up “a hot topic”. So I told them all, very politely, that I am very hurt by their decision and ultimately respect it, but due to this I am cutting myself off from the family. “A simple matter shouldn’t mean so much to me” they say. But I turn it around and say that such a small simple change shouldn’t be such an issue for them. AITA??I live in a neighborhood where houses that occupy large plots of land are being bought up by developers who build tightly packed multi-floor townhouses. Around the corner from my house two are being built. At first there were permits posted when the sidewalk was closed and street parking was unavailable. As the construction has progressed permits are not posted, signs are not put up as to whether or not the sidewalk is closed, and sometimes it can be hard to tell if construction is going on.

That being said, sometimes on weekdays and the weekends the sidewalk is open and it looks like no one is working, but electrical cables are strewn over the sidewalks. Also, even though no one is parked in an area indicating a worker, I've come across some tossing things out of a window instead of walking it down (small things). Sometimes they are also running low-lying cables from a vehicle to the site, or larger tools are left out.

I work in a job that is frequently trained in using PPE (personal protective equipment), such as hard hats, safety glasses, composite-toed boots, etc., and I've noticed that many of these workers are not wearing any of that. I'm not sure what the rules are regarding construction on private property, but I would think some of these things are always required (hello hard hat!). 

My dilemma is I feel like I need to report this, but it's not the fault of the worker for not following the rules; it is the responsibility of the construction company/contractor. While I don't want to cut off a source of income, as I know they're all just trying to make a living in an expensive city, safety is important. Also I'm not sure if some of the workers are legitimately employed (not legal citizens).

So WIBTA if I reported this to the city, which would trigger an investigation?

If it helps, my city has a ton of construction going on, but unless you are in a union finding construction/engineering work is a struggle.I’m a sophomore in college. My school (it’s a small, selective and academically inclined liberal arts college, so there isn’t much partying as opposed to the study grind. The school itself is also really opposed to frats/sororities for some reason) doesn’t have much in the way of parties, so I saw an opportunity to capitalize off of it. It’s a small school, and I generally know most people, so I know that quite a few of the people here would be willing to pay to get into parties.

So what I did was rented out a space near campus and started throwing parties, charging 30 dollars per person (the rent is hella cheap, and besides that it’s BYOB, so profit margins are high). Problem is, guy-girl ratios are really wack, which is bad because most guys who go to parties at least partially are there to get laid. This hurt the amount of people that showed up, so to incentivize girls to show up, I made the following policy:

- (this policy is in place until there are 50 girls inside, then everybody has to pay)

- If you’re a girl, you get in free

- If you’re a group of guys and girls with at least a 33/66 ratio (for example, 2 guys, 4 girls), you get 50% off

Most people are down with this, and the number of girls showing up increased drastically. However, there are a few guys who think our policies are ‘sexist and unfair’. 

I don’t agree that I’m the TA, since I’m just running a business and doing what it takes to make it profitable.

AITA?This guy in my class I’m kind of friends with was talking about how sick he was and basically was like “I’m gonna need you to do the hw for this week since I’m sick.”

First of all, just bc he is sick doesn’t mean I’m gonna do all the hw in our class and give it to him. I basically ignore this request and then like the day before it was due he goes “can you send me x”

It was a 1 point assignment and I just said yeah bc it wasn’t worth much. Well I was trying to tell him how to do it and he replies “I’m not dumb.”

So then I left him on read and never sent it.

AITA?Obviously a throw away, let's call theum B,my friend B is messaging me saying things like people are out to get them (B has had severe mental health issues for a while) after an hour of messaging and not being able to get B to contact anyone I contacted non emergency myself, I have explained everything to them and they have taken Bs number so they can call B to find out what's happening. I warned B they would be calling, and now B is saying I've put their life in danger, and I'm clearly not a true friend to call them that I am one of "them" trying to kill B. AITA for calling them? Because I feel like it right nowMy brother has Autism and doesn’t drive. My dad usually drives him to his non paying job and had accidentally scheduled a dentist appointment for that exact time. So he asked me to drop everything a drive my brother to his job and lose my pay. (The person I work for leaves home at a certain time so I have to go over before then and every time I cancel I lose that days pay). My brother doesn’t get paid nor is he expected to pay my mom $200 a month like I have to and I can’t really miss a pay day because I only make so much. AITA?I'm in college right now and there is two eatery places. One's a buffet with unlimited food/drink whatever all day. It costs one meal swipe to get in and you can't leave or you have to swipe again (they have no bathrooms inside).

My roommate and i have awfully busy schedules with many 3 hour classes everyday. This makes getting food difficult plus the eatery places close at bad times-- like 8pm when i get out of class at 9pm.

One day a week we go to the buffet and fill up our bags with chips. We each take like 3-6. This way during the week we can eat the chips for snacks during our class or if we get hungry. 

Because of college life people and our RAs always encourage us to find ways to get the best out of the meal plans because we have to pay for them, so might as well use our swipes. They always say get extra fruit, chips whatever.

Anyway today my roommate and i were at the buffett and each took 2-3 bags of chips. We always do this and no students care, but one worker lady started yelling at us. She stated we can each only take one and that we were basically ruining the meal for the gluten free kids? There are multiple stations catered for gluten free people and vegan people etc. Plus my ROOMMATE IS GLUTEN FREE. she didn't even ask just kept yelling.

we didnt want to start a fight to we each just took one today. then we overheard her talking to her coworker saying that she had to refill them and basically we were just making her job harder. Her coworker disagreed saying she had no right to be rude and cause a scene for no reason. But the lady insisted its hard to refill the chips.

Its not like we are going to a dinner buffet and stealing their shrimps in our purses. Its a university college and we are just taking chips we technically already paid forUsing a burner account. My partner (26F) and myself (26M) have been together for a year now. We’re very compatible and have a great time together. Since we met after I made a move cross country and up ended my life (not for her but for a career change, I met her after I moved) it’s been pretty intense. We’re open, we’ve both talked about it and determined the rules of our relationship.  Things have been back and forth a bit. I got laid off and have  been on UI for the last few months and she has dealing with some heavy mental health issues but we always were open with each other and try to support each other. 

Before VDay weekend I had made plans at a nice restaurant and to go to do one of her favorite activities. She tells me she never cared for v day and she would like to go to an event instead. At first I was like “No, that’s wild,” but after the realization that she really hadn’t had a chance to make friends like this for a while I put my feelings aside and said it was cool. To make up for it we made a plan to do something else. Fast forward to Vday and I’m late to that. It’s a big argument, she lets loose that she’s hates my financial situation and me being unable to keep my word. Fair enough, I acknowledge her grievances and that I’m wrong in the situation. We hash it out. The next week a freelancing client of mine can’t come through with a payment which screws my finances. Our anniversary is in March and we were planning a trip to her hometown. I had to drop out, I don’t have the money. There’s a massive fight and I don’t hear from her for days. When we do talk I come to find out that she slept with a man that she had been seeing before we met. Normally I wouldn’t give a fuck. I get being mad and stepping out and in the context of our situation it’s not inherently wrong. One of our rules though, and one that she had us put into effect, was that we won’t deal with people who we knew prior to meeting each other. She didn’t hide it but she tells me she doesn’t regret it, and that she can’t promise that it won’t happen again. I call bullshit on the whole situation, explain that I didn’t care about this rule and that it’s fucked up for her to basically say that it’s a rule for me and not for her. We end up getting rid of the rule in a renegotiation and things seem okay. I’m still hurt but I figure we can work through it. 

Later that night and we go hang out at a bar. The bartender happens to be someone who is a friend of the man that she slept with and whom I’ve never met. She introduces me as her friend. When we get back she tells me it was a slip of the tounge. I tell her it seems like she’s trying to hide me from the other dude and it’s the shady movements that accompany it that bother me. She tells me that I’m an asshole for accusing her of cheating. And sure I could be reading too much into it. Tell me reddit, AITA?Would I be the asshole if I moved back home, I (F18) am on two minds here, my dad left when I was about 7 with his wife, they moved across the world “to give me a better life“. I never seen this “better life “ from him and I’ve grown up with no financial support from him or without us having a close relationship we just talked every few weeks and seen each other like 3 times since he left . now he told me he wants me to come live with him and his wife in his country so he can make up for all he’s missed, I consider myself to be an adult and completely independent, I’ve been saving money/working for a while and just went travelling with that money on a break year so I spent basically it all except the savings I keep for absolute emergency. I made it very clear to my dad that I have no money but he says he’ll pay for everything I need/I can get a job once I get my visa. I moved to him and now I have things to pay for but no money. I can’t work till I get my visa and that’s gonna take 2+ months so I’m currently on a tourist visa . I need to go to the doctor and he keeps saying he’ll pay when he gets the chance, I’ve reminded him way too many times and I feel like such a burden asking? but even small things for eg I don’t have enough to buy razors & hair conditioner etc and I’ve asked him for money and he keeps saying he‘ll give me cash later then not doing it? Wibta if I left and went back home basically over money ? He hasn’t given me anything since I got here and we haven’t gone out once , I literally don’t do anything all day except go to the beach / gym as I have no money. 

Another situation is his wife said she has a hairdresser as a friend who can dye my hair for me and they booked my appointment then cancelled it and said they realized “it isn’t worth 100$ and I should ask my mum to pay“ I didn’t even ask for them to pay for my hair but it hurt my feelings that they said it wasn’t worth it as it’s literally the first thing they’ve done for me since I got here?  Btw it’s not that he has no money because he does


- I was stressed writing this I don’t know why the title is cut off as my plans aren’t to just leave and cut him off I meant more that wibta if I left the countrythrow away account. 

like the title says I (30m) am the owner of a fairly popular biker bar that has open mic nights for bands to play. my younger cousin (20f) has started a band a while back and has been begging me to play my bar, the thing is while they are a really good group they play pop music, while I personally don't mind it. The type of men and women who drink here would definitely do not. while they are an amazing bunch of lads and lasses there not the type to sit and listen to pop music, we mostly play metal rock and grunge bands and the one time we did try a pop band they didn't last 5 minutes before they got booed off. 

My aunt and uncle (her mum and dad) says that I should let her play as family is family, and family should come first. and that 'Oh they'll love her group' (trust me they won't.) my Cousin even asked could she play there if her band learned some rock/metal songs, I also said I didn't think it would be a good idea for you dear reader just think of bucks fizz trying to sing  Eluveitie's rose for Epona (youtube them if you don't know them) and you get where i'm coming from

 I do love my cousin and I so want to see her and her band goes far but it's my bar and I know my customers, I know full well just how rough and tumble it can get in there, they would eat her group alive. I have even offered to put in a word with a fellow bar owner where her style of music would be welcomed with open arms but NOPE they want to play my bar.) her brothers (23 and 25) see my side even my 88-year-old grandad can see it's a bad idea just not my cousin and her mum/dad, they bring it up at every family gathering and my uncle is even trying to put it into my cousins mind to just show up on open mic no warning as 'Well what are you going to do? kick your poor cousin out of your bar?'

so dear Redditers AITA?I am an assistant professor at a university with an office on the ninth floor of a building. I hold regular meetings with graduate assistants, and they are expected to attend unless they have a really good excuse. Failure to attend results in less involvement in research projects. This system is common here, and I must abide by it to maintain the respect of my department. 

Today, unfortunately, the elevator is out of order. My assistant had surgery three weeks ago and has a brace. She asked if we could meet in a lower floor communal area. There are people who walk in and out of there, and I feel like it would be too distracting. I told her that meetings are always in my office, as planned, and unless she had a statement from a physician that she could not go up the stairs, I would not change the location or cancel the meeting. I have no doubt that she can make it up the stairs, it would just take her longer than usual. She could arrive at the building earlier.

Apparently she complained to the department head. I talked to her (the head), and she said that it is my right to hold meetings wherever I find them appropriate. However, she also said, and I quote, "it seems like a dick move." I was taken aback at the inappropriate language from my head, and I am considering filing a complaint against her with the ombudsman. Sounds like someone who will seek retaliation if she is so quick to make gender-based slurs against people. I do not think I will file a Title IX claim against her, but that is not off the table. I told her I did not appreciate her words, and she said, "Just consider what I said. You can require the meeting where you would like." 

I did require it in my office. My assistant made it up. She did not seem to be in any more pain as normal. We had the meeting. I reminded her that I allowed her three weeks off of meetings, which is a big deal to me. I expected her next week whether or not the elevator is repaired. This is an inconvenience to me, as well. I am not a big fan of walking up nine flights of stairs in dress shoes, but I have to do it. 

A colleague of mine told me he would have just met her downstairs, but he did not think I made a "dick move." Another colleague told me that she would have never done what I did. I feel like they might be talking about me behind my back. Hopefully it is not the department head spreading rumors, but I will surely find out. 

I would like your opinions on my behavior but also on the behavior of my department head, as I think most would agree that even if what I did was unconventional, what she did was much worse. Thank you in advance.TL;DR at bottom
i’m  a teenager so i will probably sound bratty or obnoxious but this is really frustrating for me. 

mom is very strict about electronics. she has restrictions on my phone that turns it off at midnight and locks all the apps (no password, just have to manually turn the apps back on) and the majority of my friends are online thanks to social anxiety and a shitty school. 
today back home from school i asked her if she could take the restrictions off my phone, considering my birthday is coming up and i’m getting older and all that. of course she said no. i asked her why and she mentioned an “inappropriate” joke i made with a friend and i went silent because i knew if i kept on arguing with her about it i’d end up giving her the silent treatment and crying out of anger and frustration. she went back to work so i worked up the courage to send her this message:

“i get that you’re worried and stuff but i don’t think it’s all that fair for you to go through my phone without my permission and expect me to still trust you and the fact that i still have the restrictions even though they don’t do anything at all is just really irritating and makes me trust you even less so i don’t know what you want me to tell you”

she proceeded to tell me that i have to give her trust first before i can trust her, but i don’t think trust should work like that, especially in a parent child relationship. 
she then mentioned that u put out inappropriate things onto the internet that are all jokes. she then told me that that’s not how normal teens act. i told her that things are different from when she was a teenager, and all she had to say to that was “um, no.” i went into further explanation but she continued to disagree with me. i told her to ask my brother (about 4 years old than me) and she hasn’t responded to that message and we haven’t spoken since
TL;DR: mom and i are fighting about trust and “inappropriate” jokesMy fiancé and I flat with 4 people. I lived here first with one existing flatmate, & fiancé(M)  moved in 1&1/2 years ago. At the start of last year, two of his best friends moved in. Few months later, another of fiancé’s friends moved in (J).  

When M suggested his friends move in, I said yes on the condition that he’d be the one to talk to them if there were any issues in the house because I didn’t want to be the nagging partner stereotype, and damage my own relationships with them. 

It’s a small house for 6 people, so important we keep on top of our chores. Everyone agreed upon the chores and the schedule together. But J never contributes. 

We’ve tried to accomodate him and make it easier for him but no success. He openly says ‘I know I’m the worst with chores’ and does nothing to rectify it. He denies any wrongdoing whenever my fiancé brings it up with him.  It’s now damaging their friendship. 

It’s gotten to the point where he’s decided I’m the issue for expecting him to do his share. 

I was super warm with him when he first moved in as I wanted to make sure I had a good relationship with J for my fiancé, I lent him a bed when he didn’t have one, helped him with a few things. But since his chores have gotten worse, so has his attitude towards me.

He’s deliberately cold towards me and completely blanks me when we’re around eachother solo. If the others are around he’ll just ignore me or divert conversations to exclude me. Generally, I avoid him now because it makes me feel pretty crap. 

My fiancé and I have talked about it & he’s at the end of his rope just even trying to get J to do his chores. It’s causing fights between us, which hurts because neither of us are really the issue - it’s J’s disrespectful behaviour. 

Fiancé doesn’t want to deal with it anymore & I don’t know what else to do - whenever I ask J to do something, he blanks me. Whenever other flatmates ask him, he says he’ll get round to it & never does. 

The last straw came when J invited himself to a festival that just fiancé & I are going to alone without any of the rest of the flat (which is rare, usually everyone comes, but we’ve been pretty low key about going as we wanted to do it without a huge group for once). 

I’ve told fiancé that if J comes, he’ll ice me out all day & ruin my time. I’ve basically said if he comes, I’m going with my friends instead as I don’t wanna waste my day with someone who deliberately makes me feel like shit. Fiancé is upset, he wants us to get along but doesn’t want to talk to J about it as he’s worried J will blow up & it will ruin their already strained friendship. 

AITA for not wanting him to come to the festival?

TLDR: fiancé’s friend moved into flat w/us, friend is lazy & disrespectful, invites himself to festival with fiancé & I - I don’t want him to come. AITA?My wife is now in her mid to late second trimester. The entire pregnancy, she has all but refused to go see a doctor. This is partly because of some bad experiences she had when she was younger (a doctor didn't believe her about pain she was having in a knee and she further injured it afterwards; another doctor prescribed her medication with absolutely terrible side effects; etc.). Mostly, I would personally attribute it to the fact that she has been completely and totally indoctrinated by those god damn mommy Facebook groups, specifically one with a "free birth" movement that advocates against anything to do with hospitals, medicine, and doctors. The only time we have gone to see a doctor was to confirm the pregnancy and do blood tests and the sort. We have not been since.

She is now experiencing severe nausea and vomiting. As well as bleeding out of her vagina, really bad back pain, and very frequent urination, and a variety of other worrisome symptoms. I have begged, begged and begged for her to go see a doctor who can help her deal with these problems. I have pleaded, got on my knees and begged. Every time she dismisses me and retreats further into her echo chamber. I have gotten her own family to try to change her mind but she just is not having it. I tried to take her for a drive somewhere, with the intent of tricking her into seeing her doctor but when we arrived at the clinic she lost her shit and demanded we turned around. As a last resort, I logged into our internet router as an administrator and blocked FaceBook, Twitter, and Instagram, which is all where she gets her propaganda. I then changed the admin password so that she wouldn't be able to remove the restriction. I figured this would be effective because she's stay-at-home now, and doesn't really go anywhere unless I drive her there or she takes an Uber or a cab. 

She is now accusing me of being controlling and making decisions for her, when I am doing this for her own good. I realize that this won't fix the problem by itself but hopefully it can get her on the right track to doing what she needs to do. I believe that this is for the greater good and I'm trying all I can do to convince her to do the right thing before she or our unborn child gets seriously harmed. I mean its not like I can put her in handcuffs and involuntarily commit her to a hospital, otherwise I would have done so by now.

I have zero intention of removing the restriction until she a) sees the light or b) gives birth.I've been working a job as a barista for several months now and up till now it's been a nice job to help me get through college. Recently, I had come down with the flu, fever, had diarrhea and was throwing up (sorry for TMI). I called in sick the day of my shift since that's when the symptoms started. She made me call and text people for hours to get coverage for my shift, time that could've been spent going to a doctor or resting. In the end, no one wanted to take my shift last second and she made me come to work anyways. 
Another time, I had to suddenly take my husband to the ER to find out he was anemic, bleeding from his stomach, and in need of a blood transfusion. I had no sleep the whole night in the ER and was concerned about his condition. Same story, couldn't get coverage, was forced to come in. 
After some research a few nights ago, I found out that she's actually breaking policy which states that in cases of sudden onset illness or family emergencies that cannot be forseen, it is her job as the manager to get coverage for my shift and I am not forced to come to work. 
So, I sent an official complaint to corporate. I'm also in the first trimester of my pregnancy which has destroyed my health and I don't want to deal with needing to call in sick, so I've decided to give in my two weeks notice. 
Here is the "asshole part": would I be the ass hole if I handed her a printed copy of the specific policy to her along with my resignation and confront her about the policy and let her know that I made a complaint to corporate? lFor context, I (21M) live 12 hours away from the rest of my family. I'm never able to visit for more than a week, but I had a surgery done here recently and am spending a month recovering from it because I couldn't do it on my own. I am staying with my mom.

&#x200B;

  I have 3 older siblings (23F, 28F, 32M), and my father lived with us up until I was 16, at which time he left mom less than 2 weeks after her mom passed away. He didn't tell anybody, didn't say where he was going, and made my mom tell all of us this. He never apologized for this, to any of us. Obviously, things have been rocky since then at best. They were already pretty bad before this, but that's another post entirely. When I come home, since it's always brief, I hardly ever see him. He doesn't reach out, and I feel it's his job to try, since after all, he is my father. 

&#x200B;

 About a month and a half ago, he called me and apologized for what he did when I was 16, and in the same breath, told me that he was now dating his caretaker for a few months, but it was "not that serious". Since then, I've found out that they are living together (his idea), and that she left behind her child (18F) to live with my father. I didn't accept the apology as I felt he was only saying it to soften the blow of dating this woman.  

&#x200B;

Now that I'm home, he's given his girlfriend my number without asking me, and she's been texting me to come have lunch with her, him, or them. I have free time to do this, but no desire to. I know my dad, and he only wants to look good in front of her. It's embarrassing for him, I'm sure, but I've repeatedly said I would rather not do this, and it's been several times and she won't stop asking. I feel sick to my stomach when I see either of them, but I can't help but feeling like TA. 

&#x200B;

My dad has hurt me more than I can put into words, but he's called me a few times now, insisting that I have lunch, that it's unfair if I don't since I have time.  I can barely stand being around him/them for a few minutes, let alone an entire lunch.. AITA? Should I be giving them a chance?Last night I went on a date with a girl I met through a friend. We hit it off well so I asked for her number, we text a bit and then agreed to meet. 

A couple of hours into the date she hit me with the awkward question "what was it about me that made you ask me out?" I'm an honest kind of guy and usually do well in coming across with humour at times like this, so I just said "decent bangers, like."

She flipped and called me a misogynistic pig. I asked what was wrong with that and she said "clearly all you see in me is a pair of tits." I tried to explain that it wasn't the case, although admitted that yes they were the first things I noticed. Because they're huge.

She called me a big jawed cunt with weird eyebrows and said she was going to tell everyone how much of a scum I was. I decided to be the bigger man and kept silent until we got outside and I told her she should be proud of her tits as they're the only attractive part of her. She then spat on me so I gave her the middle finger and told her she can go and fuck off into the night.

I think things escalated because of the alcohol. Our mutual friend inboxed me today saying I'm a piece of shit that shouldn't be allowed near women. AITA?1st post on Reddit lets go! I've been best friends with Josh (fake name) for 4 years. Most problems were usually caused by; a friend saying something slightly negative about him, or a new friend in the group spreads rumors to cause drama and Josh takes their side. He took my side sometimes even when I was wrong, and always felt bad when I got him a gift for his bday (he got me a gift once). We'd be on the phone most nights for 3+ hours asking me for dating or tech advice. I'd almost do a speech of advice. He'd wouldn’t act on much I said.

There's two smaller groups in our friend group; One who's been friends for years and works to save money and enjoy the simple life. One that has been friends for less than 2 years likes to go out and spend more to enjoy life. Josh has been favoring the second group, up for spending hundreds just to escape life, and has been on dating apps, but seemed to find tiny reasons to not continue dating each girl (ex.wearing comfortable/casual clothes to a fancy mall).

For the past month Josh and I had planned to drive down to FL and stay at his relative's place with my gf and another friend. One day he called me to say he can't go with us, hung up soon after. My gf and I called the other friend and in an hour we had planned a roadtrip around a neighboring state. Josh called said he's now going to FL with family and will meet up with us down there. expecting us to still be going down to FL.

I said I would consider both plans for a couple days, to calm him down. The next day the other friend and I hung out while Josh worked. Later met up at Josh's. The other friend got there before me and said I definitely wasn't gonna go to FL.

This REALLY set him off, going on a tyrant accusing me of backing out of all his plans (ex. trip to LA in an AirBNB for like $400/night cause it's owned by a member of LMFAO), manipulating our friends, being a crappy friend, etc. He called me some REAL bad names (through school I was bullied physically, emotionally, socially, and VERBAL). He wasn't gonna listen and just wanted me to react so he can have a clean conscious playing the victim. I did not respond, only kindly asked if he wanted me to leave.

I stayed up all night w/some first group friends talking about Josh. Who texted me to tell me not to try to contact him, later text me asking if i saw how horrible my actions were. I decided to listen to his original text. Since then he's called me once and texted me about how he's so hurt how I went "behind his back" and changed "his" plans.

In his last text, he claimed it was behind him but he'd lost respect for me. He worded it so any way I answer would seem like I'm crawling back. It's been two days since his last text and I still haven't answered but am having a random, small party with the first friend group, and ROADTRIP.

TLDR: 4 year"Best Friend" accuses me of manipulating friends into changing “his” plan. Texts me, to get me to come "crawling back" to him. I'm not responding.This sounds like a clear and cut NTA, however all the other classmates seem to think the opposite... [there’s like fifteen of us]

So, our professor in college has a team-presentation; which counts towards the final grades. It’s marked as followed;
1. Class grade (where all students mark out of /5) 
2. Teammate grade (where your two other teammates mark out of /5)
3. Professor mark (where the professor marks out of /10)
to accumulate into a possible 20 marks. You, in addition, receive a breakdown, so you can see where you dropped (professor, teammates, or students.)

Alright, so in the class message group, the students all decided to mark each other 5’s and 10’s for their teammates, so everyone could get a grade boost. I disagreed, but said nothing.

On the day of the presentations, I marked fairly. Due to the low quality of the presentations, most got a 1 or a 2. In addition, I felt like my teammates slacked, so they both got a 3.

They narc’ed, and confessed that I was the reason the students didn’t get perfect scores, and now all the students are mad at me, and I’ve been called every name in the book.

Am I really the asshole here?I live with three of my best friends, and another roommate who I met just right before we moved in. For the last month, I would get home and all of my dishes that were on the drying rack would be laid out on the counter with my roommate’s dishes on the rack (the one I’m not close with). We all mostly share, and 85% of appliances/dishes are mine. The drying rack is mine. I cook A LOT and thus I constantly have dishes on the rack even if I put them away regularly. I wash right away, and usually put things away within a day. 

I approached my roommate and asked him to stop laying my dishes out and to just let me know so I can put them away, or just put the dishes away himself every so often because we share. We all use the dishes and I unload the rack all the time regardless of what’s on it. He claims “I don’t use your dishes. I only use mine and I always put my dishes away within an hour after having washed them. I don’t know where your dishes go and I’m not your parent” but ultimately agrees to stop as long as I unload the rack more frequently. He’s the only one who has his own dishes, but constantly uses my appliances, cookie sheets, frying pan, etc. Fine. Whatever. Figured this would be the end of it. Made tremendous effort to be on top of my game, putting dishes away within an hour or so of washing them for the last two weeks. 

I made breakfast yesterday and was almost late to work. So, I left the dishes on the rack for my entire 12 hour shift. This is the only time this week the rack has not basically been empty. My roommate sends me a really aggressive text saying it’s unfair to make it so that he can’t use MY drying rack, and if I have to work all day I should plan for that and empty the rack before I go or ask one of the other roommates who share dishes to do it so that I don’t put that burden on him. I explained the situation and asked him to be conscious of my schedule, and that I’ve been making a huge effort. He told me to stop getting defensive and making excuses. He also said he’s not going to applaud me for doing what I should be doing. 

WIBTA if I removed the drying rack all together, and possibly the shared pans and appliances that I KNOW he uses (while claiming not to)? I feel like it might be petty and unfair to my other roommates.This is really happening and I can't believe it.

As a student I live in a dorm while at college. It's a big building in a complex, with keycard access.

Inside it's kinda structured like a hotel.

Now the thing is, there is no doormat in this building at the entrance. All the mud or anything from outside gets inside and I was tired of constantly washing the floor in this room that is my temporary home.

I saw that at one of the ends of the hallway someone has a plastic-looking  doormat in front of their door and I thought "great idea".

Now, I'll give you all the info I think is relevant. The hallway is very large and it's at least 2m wide. The doormat I bought is just as long as my door and at max 30cm wide. It is not intrusive, and people that live next to my have nothing against it (they actually want to get some themselves).

It's a brownish doormat with a doggo that says "wipe your paws".

I put it in front of my door on Monday. Both then and the next day I found it far away from my door when I came back.

I thought someone is playing some bad jokes, but today it took me a longer time to find it. Attached to it was a note: "No rugs, annoying!!!!" (Translated)

I don't get it. How could I inconvenience someone with my doormat? I would put it on the inside, but the door opens inward. Also, it seems like the other person's doormat is gone too.

I don't know what's up with this.

I seriously thought about putting it back with a note stating that I have no rugs, only a doormat, but I see how that may escalate this.

Edit: The admin said it's okay to have a doormat. Also, legally here you own 1m in front of your door in apartment type buildings even when rented.

If it would be a house I would own the sidewalkI am getting married in the near future.  I am not an etiquette expert so maybe I did something wrong.

I sent out invitations for my upcoming wedding and as RSVPs trickled in, an invited couple asked if they could bring their daughter.  I asked what daughter, thinking they had a small child that I was forgetting.  They replied that they were referring to their year 20-year-old daughter. I said that since she is an adult that I don't really know I would rather not invite her.  

This apparently angered them and after a couple other exchanges (texts, kinda whiney but not heated) I relented and said she could come, since otherwise the couple would not come either.  This was apparently still not good enough because they said they were insulted by me initially declining to invite her.  AITA for not automatically inviting someone's adult child to my wedding? Is that a normal thing?So I recently started enjoying photography and I wanted to start a business over it.  I realized that no one would pay me unless I had a decent work, and I couldn't get work unless I got people to pay me. So the next best solution was to do free photo shoots. I message around 10 of my friends offering a free photoshoot, only 2 of them accepted. Cool.  On Sunday I do the photoshoot, the pictures come out amazing, and now I have decent work to show people. A week after that one of the friends I messaged asks me if I can do a free photoshoot of her. I tell her no, I charge $50-$60 for a shoot. She then asks me what about the photos you offered last week. I simply tell her that is over, I 'm doing paid work now. She then tells me I am a fake friend,  and stops being in contact with me for that week, she then posts on her story, something about people switching up on you, or something like that.  I tell my friends and they agree that I was the asshole in that situation.

AITA?

&#x200B;

edit: clarity error

&#x200B;

2nd edit:

1. She specifically said no to the photoshoot
2. I did not provide a timeline to end the free photos
3. I posted the pictures to my instagram, I don't know if she saw them or notMy life isn't great, but it's okay. My husband and I got pregnant at a not great time in our marriage. We were on the fence about keeping the pregnancy when I got diagnosed with uterine cancer, which turned a "maybe someday" into "this is your only chance to ever have a biological child". I was a contract worker with no maternity leave, so we decided that I would work as long as I could, then quit after the baby was born and start applying for jobs when the baby was old enough for daycare. Our child is now almost 3.

Unfortunately, my mother started declining hard towards the end of my pregnancy, and by the time the baby was 3 months old, she had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and needed full time care and a POA (power of attorney). I took over her care and we moved into her house for her safety. While I'm registered as her carer, because I have power of attorney, I can't get financial assistance for it. She doesn't have money for elder care, and Medicare isn't willing to pay anything because she isn't legally destitute, so everything would have to be paid for by us.

Between daycare and what an in-home carer would cost, I would need to make over $5,000 a month, or it will cost our household money for me to work. The jobs I did before all of this net about $3,000 a month, which means it would likely cost us over $2,000 a month for me to work. 


A friend of mine got pregnant at the same time I did. She terminated. She's since had another termination. We were talking the other day and she was judging me for not working and my life in general. She said that I was being a drain on my husband and that I/we were bad parents for having a baby when we couldn't *really* afford it. She went on to say that she's circumstantially infertile because she refuses to have a kid unless she can fully pay for them to go to college and have a basically upper middle class life.

I responded that that pregnancy was our only chance to have a child, that we were in no way neglecting our child because we didn't have a college fund, and that she's not infertile. Have kids or don't, that's your choice, but multiple abortions by choice is not infertility. I also told her the above, that we honestly can't afford for me to work, and that being a working mom is sometimes an economic privilege. She stormed out and we haven't spoken in over a week. Am I in the wrong here?So I was trying to finish some of my chores and I heard some screaming in my sons room. I ran into the room seeing my daughter trashing and breaking my sons room because she did not like how my son is not allowing her to use and break his things. I saw that and was mad because this was not the only time my daughter did that and it was the 6th time. I was done with her behavior and I told her I am tired of her not respecting other people's property in the house which was a rule set in kindergarten. 

I told her that I am kicking her and she has a month to pack her stuff and find a place. She asked why can't I kick out my older son and not her. I told her that my older son never broke or screamed like a five year old and that he pays rent, helps with bills and follows the rules we set for him. She was threw a fit of rage and left and pack her stuff and went to a friends house. Her friends mom came in and asked me to reconsider my stance and allow her back in and I refused.

Edit- thank you for those who gave me your opinions.  I am going to let my daughter back in the house in a couple of conditions. The first one is that she has to apologize to my son. The second one is that my daughter has to go to therapy. The third condition is she has to pay for a new speaker and help pay for repairs of the phone that was broken which my son has. The final condition is that she is not allowed to ruin property and if she has an issue with my son she has to bring it up with me. If she breaks any of the rules she will have a month to pack her belongings and get out. There are no second chances.I’ve been involved with a man for several months who is undergoing a divorce. The involvement is purely physical, and we aren’t dating. Out of nowhere, his soon-to-be ex-wife contacted me last week and wanted to chat. 

She wanted a face-to-face meeting to ask me questions last week. I asked my friend over the weekend whether it would be ok for me to meet with her. He gave me the blessing since the papers have already been filed with the court and they are just waiting for the judge to sign off. He just asked me to be honest. There was nothing further her attorney could do to get out of the terms of the prenup because it was pretty thorough, and her attorney advised her to accept the terms and proceed with an uncontested divorce to save her the financial burden of a legal battle that has almost no chance of succeeding. She rightly accepted her counsel’s advice.

So today I met her for coffee in a very public space. She wanted to know when I started seeing my friend sexually, and I told her. She wanted to know if it was anything she did that changed their relationship. I told her I didn’t know the full extent of their problems so I couldn’t answer that question. What I did know was that he no longer found her attractive after she gave birth to their second child. He found himself no longer sexually compatible with her. I told her if it wasn’t me, he would have found someone else. She wanted the truth, so I told her.

She started sobbing and accusing me of being callous. I reminded her that she wanted honest answers, and I gave her the answers. My friend had already told her exactly the same thing when he served her the divorce papers months ago. I’m not sure what she was hoping to gain by asking the same questions of me. 

Frankly, I think getting out of this marriage is the best thing to happen to her because she shouldn’t be under the illusion that she could somehow save this marriage. She needs the bandaid ripped off so she can move on with her life. Obviously I didn’t tell her this because she didn’t ask me this and I’m not her therapist. 

I paid for her coffee and I left. I didn’t want to be seen with a sobbing woman at the cafe and she probably could have benefited from some time alone to compose herself. I honestly don’t understand why she would seek out a meeting with me and ask me for honest answers if she isn’t prepared to hear them. I just don’t see myself as either an asshole or as being callous here, especially when she asked for this.

Edit: someone suggested I add in this from INFO. The youngest child is 2-3. The sexual dissatisfaction occurred over years, culminating in my friend moving into his own downtown condo shortly before he served his soon-to-be ex-wife the divorce papers.My daughter, Lila, is 3 months old, and a very loud crier. As my nanny Maureen would have said "she's got a set of lungs on her". GP and books all say sleep training should start at 4-6 months.

My parents live a few hours away and shortly before my daughter's birth mum had a knee replacement. At her last checkup, a week ago, she was advised against driving for at least the next few months, and told she won't be able to drive long distances (like the drive to our place) until next year. Dad has an eye issue and legally can't drive because of it. As a result of this, they have yet to meet Lila. We've been talking on the phone where I've given them information, I've sent pictures and even facetimed them and put Lila on camera, and they've been begging me and my fiance to bring Lila to them for a visit. We made the trip last weekend.

We arrived Friday night. Mum got dad to buy/put up a crib specifically for Lila, however, they put it together in the spare room. So mum and dad were in their room, me and my fiance were in the guest room, and our daughter was in the spare room. The crib was heavy, wooden, and wide, and had come as a flatpack and was built in the room, and when we told dad that Lila sleeps in our room he and my fiance tried to get the crib into the guest room, but they couldn't get it through the door. There was no bed in the spare room so we realised pretty quick that we wouldn't be able to have her in the same room as us. We made our peace with it as the spare and guest room are next to each other and she's so loud we didn't doubt we'd be able to hear her.

Sure enough, Friday night, there are 3 total crying sessions we deal with.

Saturday morning mum tells us we should let her cry it out. I tell her we've not started sleep training yet because she's too young and we don't like "cry it out" in general. Conversation moves on.

Saturday night happens. We put Lila down, and go to bed ourselves. Within 10 minutes she's crying. I get up, go to the room she's in, and the door is locked. I panic, go into mum's room, asking where they key is. Mum says we need to let her cry it out and start sleep training and she's helping us do that. I then get dad, who tells mum to give me the key right now. She does, I get Lila, and put her back to bed.

The next dad mum calls me a helicopter parent and says I can't console her every time she cries. Dad and fiance tell her to leave it alone. We left Sunday afternoon (as planned).

Yesterday mum rang to ask when we're next coming, and tells me the crib was bought for Lila when we came over. I told her I need to think.

WIBTA if I said to mum that I don't want to stay overnight at their place any more?

Just to add/clarify: we have no intention of letting her ever have to "cry it out". We think when it comes to sleeping in separate rooms (which is months away) if we do any sort of method it will be the pick up/put down method, where we make sure she's had a feed and a bath and is all good for the night, and if she cries during the night we will stay with her long enough to get her to stop crying/give her whatever she needs, and then leave her to it. She's also a month premature, so developmentally she's closer to 2 months than 3. Also my dad had nothing to do with locking Lila in, and didn't know what mum was planning until I was in their room demanding the key, and is generally on my side in this.I went over for a date, with a guy I have been on multiple dates with, he now lives 2hrs and 15 min away from me, I let him know I didn't want to drive home in the dark, this still left us with around 3 hrs to hang out. When I got to his place he was not dressed, nor was he ready to leave, no big deal, but he decided he just wanted to cuddle and discuss what to do, 2 hrs go by he ends up napping some, he works nights and has been not doing well mentally, but I had enough and I told him I'm going home. I kept it short, because I was upset, no date, no food, and i got to watch him sleep after a 2 hr drive.

My question AITA for cutting it shortI’m 29 and have been sober for 5 years. 

My sponsor Daren passed away a year ago from cancer. I credit him with saving my life more than once. 

My family has a tradition of being buried together in a family plot. It has been done for decades and they are all pretty adamant about it. 

My parents are getting older and have started to finalize exactly where they want us all to be buried. They picked a spot for them and for me and my sister. We didn’t get much choice (or any) in the matter. It get that it’s weird, but whatever it’s what we’ve always done in my family. 

My family stuck by me through my addiction for the most part but they didn’t help me like Daren did. 

What my family doesn’t know is that I’m gay and Daren and I were on and off lovers for years while he was my sponsor. Say what you will about the ethics of that, but it worked for us. I genuinely cared for him and miss him. 

I never told my family because I didn’t want them to see him as any less as the great mentor he was and I haven’t come out to them yet. 

When my parents brought up our burial plots, I said that I wanted to be buried next to Daren instead as I credit him with my sobriety and just still being alive. 

My parents were upset and said that I was ruining tradition and “upsetting the family with my antics” once again. They said they understood that we were close but Daren wasn’t family and this was tradition. I told them my mind was made up and refused to talk about it any further. 

My parents were upset and I’m now suspecting that my sister thinks there was more going on between me and Daren than I told her. 

I don’t want to break family tradition but I also don’t know if I’m entirely in the wrong here. 

AITA?Student in my first semester of college living in a dorm with roommate J.

J sought me out a few months before college began, she thought we could be roommates. Move in day we were BFFs, but as the 1st week progressed I noticed her acting strange.

I brought a new friend to my dorm when J was there. After friend and I left, friend said “YOU are J’s roommate? We went to the same high school, I know her from home. She told me her roommate is weird; I expected someone actually weird.”

This explained why J seemed off, she thought I was weird, but I didn’t know why. I went to class, went out weekends and came back when J was asleep w/o being loud. I had friends I was with a lot of the time, I was clean.

I have 4 classes throughout the day (8-9, 11-12, 2-3, 5-7). Between them, I make the 15 min walk back to my dorm and lay in bed. J doesn’t have her first class until 2 pm. By the time I get back at 12, J is still in bed. I am cautious about being loud in the mornings while she is asleep, I don’t turn on lights, I either use the sunlight or go in the bathroom to get ready, I’m quiet with drawers, I spray my perfume in the hallway.

J wakes up for her day when I get back around noon. I noticed that I would lay down for a nap/close the blinds, while she would get up/turn on lights/heat up food. One day I had not slept the night before because I was uncomfortable (J likes our room at 70 degrees and I like it at 60, we “compromise” and keep it at 70) and I was sick of her doing this, so I told her how disrespectful it was. 

Her response: “You sleep ALL THE TIME. Am I not allowed to be in my room?”

I know it must be annoying to only ever see me napping, but she sleeps through me going to class, coming back, and going again. If I respect her sleep, she should respect mine. 

We had a discussion with RA about it who said J was only allowed to turn on 1 light while I was trying to nap, but of course, J always turns on the brightest one and opens the blinds.

Last night, I couldn’t sleep. I left at 7:30 for class, went to the library, went to my second class, and got back to my dorm at 12:30, exhausted. As I laid down, J got out of bed, turning on the overhead light, opening the blinds, shuffling through her drawers, and microwaving popcorn. 

J and I do not talk, we haven’t in a few weeks, and her temper scares me enough to not confront her (except for the time I did, which proves my point). Every morning when I wake up at 7 I want to turn on the lights, open the blinds, and be loud so she gets the same treatment I do, but I feel like I’m not that mean- also I’m worried about her backlash. 

My friends/family side with me saying that I should be allowed to nap in my own room. They think J doesn’t like having a roommate in general, so she nitpicks over small things. J’s family/friends side with her, saying it isn’t fair of me to be angry about her going about her daily life in the middle of the afternoon. 

So, AITA for taking naps in my dorm room during the day?I work in an industry that is disproportionately male dominated. As a woman, I've really appreciated having "gated communities" of likewise individuals, which extends to the LGBTQ+ community. While I do not identify as such, I consider myself an ally to that community.

One of the hallmarks of a specific community I frequent is to warn members of the community if certain folks in the industry are exhibiting behavior that could be problematic or even dangerous. I fully support this, as it keeps the more vulnerable members of our community safe. 

Recently a specific individual was called out for asking a member of the community for free work. Asking for free work, even a passion project, is what I would call "shitty behavior". It's a yellow flag, and I fully support a warning put out to be a bit cautious around this person so, again someone vulnerable, doesn't get snookered in. My motto, and the best advice I've had, is you don't always have to work for money but never work for free.

A moderator of this community then posted that this called out person would be at a specific event at an enormous conference that is upcoming, and that people shouldn't go. Here is where I felt a line was crossed. Canceling, or shunning, is the nuclear option when dealing with misconduct. If we're talking overt sexism, gross sexual misconduct, I'm all for the nuclear option. But over asking for free work? No.

I message the mod in question privately and explained how I felt. A different mod reached out, explained to me after I pried that the person in question is actually a sexist pig. I asked that the call out in question be updated with this info, because I have a problem with cancelling over basically nothing. They said they should edit: should not  have to, because the burden of proof doesn't lie with the victim. So, because I started out defending such a shitty person I obviously was a shitty person as well, and also because I wouldn't budge how I felt that a cancel needs to be justified I was banned.

Was I the asshole?Hi! Today, I attempted to go do my laundry, when my foot slipped off of the step at the back door and caused me to sprain my ankle. This, obviously, hurts. I spent about an hour laying down on the floor waiting for my grandmother to come to my house to help me with it, and she ended up giving me ice and helping me around and doing some of my laundry so I'll have clothes, sat down and talked, etc. I really appreciated it!

&#x200B;

However. Just as she was leaving, (3 hours later) my mother came home. I currently live with my mom while going to college, so I'm doing my best to be nice to her. She really didn't show too much care that I had sprained it, and once my grandmother was gone, blamed the fact that I chose to wear flip flops as to why I sprained my ankle. Obviously, I felt uncomfortable when she said that and felt bad, but maybe I shouldn't have worn flip flops?

&#x200B;

She left, but not long after I had gotten onto my computer to talk to my friends about it and relax, she came back in and told me that I had to be laying in bed and that "This day off was not just a vacation day." It wasn't like I was faking it or anything, I have ice on my foot and was keeping pressure off it so that it didn't hurt, and I have a sleeve on it to keep down the swelling. She ended up completely rearranging my stuff around my bed somewhat passive-aggressively (commenting about how I'm always on my computer and never do anything else), even though I repeatedly asked her not to. I feel incredibly uncomfortable now, and I am afraid my ankle won't be good enough for me to drive and walk around a mile in two days as she is repeatedly stating I am going to be doing. I do accept that maybe it's ridiculous that I don't feel like I need to be bed bound, but also don't feel like I can walk.

&#x200B;

I feel like I'm the asshole because she might mean well? You shouldn't really be going around having too much fun when injured generally, maybe? Or maybe she's just worried over me and I should just let it go.... I could also be rude for not being completely on board with definitely going around and just taking painkillers Friday.

AITA for being uncomfortable and feeling like she doesn't really care about it, and is just mad at me for being on my computer and spraining it, because she really does care? Or is she actually just being the asshole when my ankle is sprained?

EDIT: sorry, put wrong age in title. I’m 17.So this just happened, and I'm honestly not sure how to feel about this (throwaway account for reasons) I woke up this morning to my niece crying about something or other, listening to my mom and sister talk, I figured out it was due to a DIY blood test, that I've personally taken. My family is super for balance between Omega 3/Omega 6 acids (which for those of you that don't know is one of the best things you can do for your health) and that test was to check how close to said balance she was. While I'm all for physical health and such, I just didn't see a reason why that test had to be done, and why it had to be a DIY test. I'll admit I'm a bit biased against blood tests due to my phobia for blood/needles, but I do still take them when I need to as my health is more important to me than my phobias. After hearing and seeing all of this, I started sending my mom and sis messages on the phone about how she's 5 and can say no if she doesn't want to. After all of this went down, my mom came in and told me how apperantly she's been having a lot of pain in her feet and arms during the night and this is just one of those steps for helping her get better (she's apperantly taking painkillers due to how bad they get, which is super bad for a 5 year old) and I'm just kinda torn, AITA here?

&#x200B;

Edit: I seem to have done a poor job of explaining how the DIY blood tests work, sorry. Basically you have a one time use needle that'll pierce the skin on the tip of your ring finger (I think it's the ring finger) to get blood to form, you then put it on a piece of paper and package it up to send to a lab.So I've been friends with this person before there transition, she a trans woman btw, and most of our jokes usually are us picking on each other. She came out as trans last year but has only been taking hormones for about two months, she's still like to pick on everyone in the friend group but when ever one of us picks on her she gets upset. Recently while me, her, and some other friends where getting something to eat my friend found some old audio from an old podcast we did for fun. She then ask if she still sounded like that, I said yes. Hear voice is still the kinda the same she just sounds more feminine in her wording. A few days later she decided to tell everyone in our friend group that I'm a toxic person, transphobic, and that she's trying talking to me about it and that I wouldn't listen despite the fact that I haven't recieved any messages from her on anything. The only way I found out was that my sister told me because she's apart of this friend group then my other friend ask me what going between me and the trans friend. I told them everything that happened and they think I should apologize even though I probably did nothing wrong. I dont want to apologize because I believe I did nothing wrong and because instead of actually talking to me she decided to tell everyone that I'm a horrible person. Am I the asshole?I'm currently 15 m. My dad, brothers, grandma, aunt, and idk was there 1 more person or not, decided to all go eat lunch at a restaurant today, everyone and especially my grandma wanted me to come there and I decided not to go. The only reason was because I didn't want any of my friends for example to see me, and I live in a small town of about 15k people, so not much and not that many restaurants overall in this whole town. So the chances that I would have seen someone I know at least a little bit, were very high and I was just scared of that. I wanted to go eat, especially to a restaurant but that was the only reason I didn't go.

Now I feel bad for not going since everyone wanted me to come. And also fuck this shit, I somehow would like to get rid of this fear I guess, that I don't want to go out with my family because my friends might see me or someone I know or that they know me a little bit. Since like 90% of my aged people here at least knows a little bit almost everyone. I like going out with my family, to do stuff, one example is going to eat lunch at a restaurant, which I haven't done in a very very long time because of this fear.

But I really do feel bad now, since everyone that was there like before me and my dad we're supposed to go there, they we're a little bit early, and then I didn't go and only my dad went and all of the people there were waiting for both of us. Also, I don't want anyone from my family to feel like I don't want to go out with them because they are for example "embarrassing" or something similar and that's the reason I don't go out with them, since that's not any of the reasons, they aren't. I love all of them and  a lot and nothing is wrong with them, I just for some reason don't want to see any of my friends when i'm out with my family. I guess it would be "weird", when i'm going to eat lunch with my family and then I see my friends and they see us, and they're all hanging in a group of like 5-10 people.I (21F) have a brother (20M) and we both go to the same college, but due to my brother taking pre-K, he's a sophomore and I'm a senior. Both of us grew up with ADHD, and it made school very difficult for us. Our parents helped us the best they could with tutors and study tips for people with our ADHD and we both managed to get decent grades. We both had issues with science and math, which led me into not picking a major that didn't involve high levels of either of the subjects. I struggled with the intro math classes but still managed to pass.

When my brother started off as a freshmen he went undecided. I gave him advice about what are the best general education classes to take, ones to avoid stuff like that.... and then decided he wanted to go into biology and become a chiropractor. My parents were open to it at first but I cautioned him that he would most likely need to go to grad school and maintain a decent GPA (he only had a 2.6 in high school), and he would be taking entirely math and science classes. He said he can do it, I said okay, I ended it at that and didn't say anything else about it. 

A year later, he fails half of his classes, and he asks me what he should do. I encouraged him to think about switching majors. My brother gets mad at me, my parents get mad at me and yell and say it's what he wants to do and I should be supportive. I decided I'm staying out of this as they clearly didn't want any more "advice".

Well now my parents are freaking out because he has a 2.3 GPA and he's currently failing his classes and is on the verge of being kicked out of the major and being put on academic probation ( for the second time). His worst class grade is in a class he already failed. The university has a policy that if you fail the same class twice, you're unable to take it again. My parents are now asking what can he do, and I said well you didn't listen to me then and now it's clearly a problem that isn't getting better. I told you he should change majors but you didn't listen and now your son is screwed, and I don't know what he can do to fix it. They're mad and saying I'm unsupportive and an AH for not helping my brother enough

First off,  I only gave him advice because I know how hard it was for him in school and I was just trying to help him put himself in a better position post-grad. But now I'm feeling like I was too harsh with what I said, AITA?I (F/30) am getting married next month and my partner (M/35) and I have everything we would need in our household since we combined our separate households into one when we moved in together. We are getting married at the courthouse and then doing dinner/drinks with immediate family and friends. 

Both of our families wanted to host a dinner for extended family after our wedding. We agreed because we didn't want to be jerks about it, but neither of us really want that. My partner's mom asked me for my input on everything when she planned the party for her side that's happening this summer. We said we didn't want any gifts so she put "no gifts please" on the invitations. 

My mom had said we would probably do a cookout at her house for my extended family and I was happy about that because I thought it would be more low key. Then she texted me and my sisters on a group chat a few weeks ago and asked what we were doing the Friday after we get married. I said I didn't have any plans yet, and she was like good we want to plan a dinner for our side of the family at this fancy Italian restaurant. So I went along with it even though I wasn't super happy and I wish she had even just asked me before sending it out to me and my siblings. Then I was at dinner with my immediate family and one of my sisters showed the other the invitation for this dinner and refused to show me when I asked. I was told I should learn patience. I asked them if they could include the "no gifts please" on that and that started a fight at dinner because I am not giving my family an opportunity to be involved in my wedding. My other sister told me I was being too controlling. 

I don't think I was being controlling, but when talking to a colleague she said it is normal for people to bring a gift or money and I shouldn't try and stop people from doing that. I just really don't want people to spend money for my wedding and I think it is weird because my partner and I don't need anything. So AITA here? Should I just go with the flow?My sister and I have had a pretty sheltered and cushy life.  I have never had to experience poverty, starvation, or intense sickness without care in my life.  The only real toil I have faced in my life was my parents getting divorced when I was 11 and even that didn't really affect me.  The divorce is kind of the root of the problem.  My sister, when it first happened, was very pissy to the point that she would throw tantrums if she didn't get her way.  After years of this, my parents just decided to let her have what she wants in order to avoid her wrath.  Anyways, the other day my mother was in America for a few days because my grandparents did not want her to leave because of coronavirus.  While she was gone, my sister did not do anything too egregious.  She left some clothes around, didn't clean up plates, and didn't help me vacuum but that wasn't out of the ordinary.  On the last day though, she invited 5 friends over and with the rest of the grocery money bought a bunch of food and soda at the store (about 800 HKD or \~100 USD).  After she had finished with that, all her friends left and she sat on the table and started watching TikToks on her phone. I asked her to help me put stuff away and clean up and she would keep on saying "in a second" or "Give me a bit". I started cleaning up and asked for her help putting in a new bag in the trash.  She said she didn't know how so I said I would teach her.  She started getting annoyed and I was a bit angry so I said something along the lines of "How are you going to survive in college. You don't have any skills in life, you don't know how to clean up for yourself, you can't cook, you don't know how to clean, etc".  She yelled about how she doesn't need to stay in the kitchen that isn't her job and stormed off.  She hasn't spoken with me since and I think is deliberately being messier now. AITA.

&#x200B;

I think I might have made this a bit biased towards myself and one-sided.  For clarification, I did yell at her.  She's 14, I'm 16.  

&#x200B;

Also no. I don't beat her, gaslight her, or think that she is inherently less because she is a woman.My roommate has a friend over a lot who, to me, appears very male. This friend (I’m already struggling to not say he) has a beard, big build, hairy legs, low voice — is basically everything I know as masculine with an exception of longish hair and full face of makeup (that looks great btw). 

But due to this person’s features, I can’t stop saying ‘he.’ And I’ve tried saying ‘they,’ but it just hasn’t been able to stick no matter how hard I try, and this person really isn’t happy about it.My mom has been pressuring me since I was in college to support the family (I’m 27 now), and I’ve been trying to pay for things (phone bill, internet, mortgage, car insurance, property tax) but I’m also trying to save a lot towards a down payment. I’ve known ever since I was a child that my relationship with my mom was not good and that I wanted to move away from her. We have intense fights every few months that usually end in her giving me ultimatums - you’re trash, it was a waste of my effort to raise you, you don’t care about me at all, you owe me your life and if you don’t support me, then you have to move out. Then you’re cut off. Then I’ll sell the house. What’s worse is that my family history is kind of complicated (I’m the oldest of three, and my younger sister is my half-sister from my mom’s second marriage that ended in divorce. My mom’s second husband used up a lot of her savings and left her in debt). My mom’s been blaming me as the reason for why our family is in debt now, and doesn’t acknowledge the fact that she was tricked by her ex-husband. She tries to put my half-sister against me, even though we normally have a good relationship otherwise. I’ve been considering more than ever to move out, but today, I heard my mom passive aggressively tell my brother that she lost her job for the next few weeks and that she fully expects any functioning member of this family to pay for her expenses. If not, then she’ll sell the house. My brother and sister have nowhere to go if she sells the house.... 

I’m sorry if this is really confusing, but I’m having a really hard time piecing my thoughts together. I’ve been having a miserable week trying to avoid coming home and dealing with this, but I don’t have anywhere else to go right now.So I work at this shop that's got a sandwich line, a barista, and a cashier. I've worked all three, and know how to make everything. I was working cashier today.

In the beginning, we were friends- but coworker friends- not someone I would hang out with outside work. We'd shoot the breeze and shit. But over the last couple of months, I've noticed small things that just irk me that I ignored because they were a friend. They take 10 minute bathroom breaks like every hour. They ask other people to do their job for them even when they're busy. They stand in my space, like super close. And the big one is that they always interrupts me when I'm cashiering and someone asks me a question. I'll literally take a breath to answer and he'll run over from the sandwich line to answer. Usually it's about the ingredients in the food, which I can answer because I've made the food multiple times. I legit just glared at them today when they did it and interrupted me in the middle of speaking.

And the top of the cake is the incident later today. I had a cup of water that I had on a table. No lid. This is basically how it went.

Them: "You need a lid"

Me: "\[My boss\] has never told me that."

Repeat this again about three times, until they finally screamed at me "well good for you not putting a lid on your fucking cup!" Did it in front of a customer and at least two coworkers. I walked over, got a lid for my cup, and served the next customer. 

But frankly, I don't know if I would be the asshole or not if I used this as an excuse to just politely interact with them, but not anymore than necessary. They did apologize after, but I was angry still because it was inappropriate. 

I'm also just done with their shit. Everything is the misery olympics with this person. I don't want to deal with them anymore. 

Would I be the asshole, reddit?There’s a lot of backstory here but I’ll try to make it short.

I’m 20F, I still live at home because I decided to go to community college. I’m in my last semester and once I graduate I plan to get a job. I currently don’t have my license (a long story) but I can get it soon.

About a month ago my friends invited me to come to their house for a few days. They live about a 6 hour drive away. They took my boyfriend and I there in December, and we had a great time so they wanted us to come again. However, my boyfriend couldn’t get off work so it would just be me.

When I told my mom that I was going, she was immediately pissed off. I really don’t have a great relationship with her for a lot of reasons so sometimes I can’t tell if I’m overreacting or she is. She basically told me that I couldn’t go because “it was a bad time” and I would be the “odd one out”. She’s constantly convinced I’m going to get kidnapped or murdered, and apparently if my boyfriend isn’t there it’s a guarantee.

Her biggest thing that she always says to me is: “you live here, so you have to listen to me.” I can understand if she didn’t want me doing drugs in the house or something like that but not letting me go out seems really controlling. Until last year she would actually forbid me from leaving the house to hang out with my friends if she decided to.

I fully intended to go on the trip regardless of what she thought, but I ended up not being able to go due to weather conditions. Well, my friends and I decided on a new time to go and my mom is still pissed. She keeps telling me I’m not allowed to go without my boyfriend, guilt tripping me, and saying it’s still a bad time.

For more context: my friends are dating, they live with the boyfriend’s parents, I’ve known them for about two and a half years and my boyfriend has known them for even longer. There’s literally no reason for her to be worried but she keeps calling them strangers and saying she doesn’t trust them.

So AITA if I don’t listen to my mom’s bullshit and still go on the trip/AITA for not listening to her even though I still live at home?
