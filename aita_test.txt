Any advice or questions are welcome. Thank you.My (23/F) roommate Cara (24/F) was burning a lot of incense in our apartment. I have a very sensitive nose and just about everything sets off my allergies, and the incense creates heavy smoke that makes it hard for me to breathe and makes my eyes water. So I asked Cara if she could refrain from burning incense in the apartment. She told me that it was a spiritual thing for Hindus, not just that she liked the smell, so she refused to stop entirely but said she’d stop doing it in most of the common areas. Her compromise was that she can burn incense in the entryway where she has some kind of a religious shrine, and in her own bedroom where I think she might have another smaller one.

So that’s what she’s been doing for the last week or so, and honestly it hasn’t made a big difference. I’m still very physically uncomfortable whenever she burns incense, and now that she’s burning more of it in her room than before it’s actually a lot harder for me to get to sleep at night because of the way the smoke gets in my room.

I’m hesitant to say anything else to her because I feel like she theoretically should be allowed to do whatever she wants in her own room, plus she already agreed to cut down on the incense burning by a lot compared to how much she used to. I’m also not totally sure if I’m being insensitive to her culture in some way if I keep making a big deal about it.

Would I be the asshole to ask her to stop burning incense altogether?I work with a group of people who are all rather dysfunctional as a group. I came onboard about a year and a half ago and it was a bit of a shock to me since my previous coworkers and I were all very close. Navigating this new dynamic has been difficult but I try to remain neutral. In general they don’t really acknowledge things like birthdays or major life events which is fine because for the most part none of them even like each other. 

When I became a licensed foster parent and received my first placement with the intention to adopt they weren’t very supportive, which again is fine, they’re coworkers not friends. My old coworkers however threw me a shower and bought all kinds of presents for the baby and there were a lot of happy tears and support. 

Now one of the girls at the office has gotten engaged. I use this word loosely as there was never a real proposal and they aren’t having a traditional wedding, just a courthouse wedding and very small dinner for immediate family and she has mentioned cancelling the whole thing several times. I congratulated her and told her I was very happy for her (which I am) and I felt like that was all I really needed to do. 

Now another coworker wants to plan a bridal shower for her at work and have everyone throw in for a gift card and bring food. I haven’t responded to the emails yet because I’m just not interested in participating and the whole thing feels disingenuous. I don’t feel like I should be forced to be supportive to people who aren’t supportive to me. 

AITA and being petty here or is it appropriate for me to politely decline involvement in her shower?While I was growing up I lived with my paternal grandparents, my mother has never made an effort to have a relationship with me, she focused on her husband and 3 kids. I've always felt like a stranger around her.

When she heard I was pregnant to her first grandchild ahe changed drastically, she would call everyday to check on me, sounded excited, etc.

I gave birth and a lot of people came to meet the baby, including my mother.  My stepmom who actually tried to care for me before I moved with grandparents. Besides seeing the baby once and leaving for 3 days to be with her son that lives 3 hrs away from me she came back and started to make my stepmom feel uncomfortable making snarky comments at her and acting super rude, I had to ask her to leave since she was acting disrespectful and also I just gave birth so no stress wanted.

She got upset by that and didn't contact me in 6 months, when she did via chat she asked about my son bit then ghosted me again for a couple of months more.

Now the reason I dont allow her to see my child:

She drove from PA to FL for the birth of her 2nd grandchild, stayed at her son's house for a whole month to bond with baby did'nt stop on their drive to FL and went straight to their son's house.

She calls me like 2 weeks of being at my brother's house and tells me she would like to see my son, she said she was gonna stop by on her way back to PA and I got very pissed of because it triggered the back and forth relationship she had with me and how much it hurt me that I refuse to let that happen to my son. Or you are either willing to have a constant relationship or bye bye!

For those who would like to know My son is 17 months.

Thank you for all pf your comments, I wish some family members were as understanding cause they think I'm being mean and harsh.My adoptive parents me love me and have taken care of all of my material needs, paid for my college and showered me with presents at every holiday. However, I don't feel close with them at all.

As a four-year-old adoptee with a lot of trauma, I learned that my new parents were too sensitive for any mention of my former life. It made them sad, so as a courtesy to them I worked through it privately. Now I find it uncomfortable to expose any personal feelings to them. This is the dynamic they set up, and I don't feel bad maintaining it. 

My sister A has a different dynamic. She was younger than me so I don't think she needed to hide  her memories. She's more bonded with our adoptive parents.

Now while I'm in college our bio aunt finds us on facebook and tells us 1) our bio mom is recently deceased 2) we have a younger sister, Z, and 3) they would like to meet us.

Sister A living is living at home. She was excited to have a younger sister and told our mom, who responded, "Yes, we knew your mother had another daughter." A texted me about it disappointed.

This is where my rage comes in. I protected my parents my whole life while they were sitting on information that would have meant the world to me, and now my aunt found us six months too late to meet my bio mom.

My parents called me later that day, pretending to be excited for me. I politely changed the subject and refused to engage when they brought it up again. I refused to engage the whole time I was making plans with sister A to go visit our bio family. When we met our bio family it was the most amazing feeling of finally being home, finally being accepted and seen and understood. 

A I think felt like they were family too, but when we went back to our parents house and I still refused to talk to them about my experience she started to get angry. It hurt our parents feelings that I obviously feel closer to the bio family than them, and I'm sure when I went back to college they cried to her about it. Since then she's been telling me I'm a horrible person and a sociopath like our bio mom. When I tried to tell my friends how angry I am at my parents they keep mentioning gratitude, which I find rude and I've never heard as advice to any non-adoptee complaining about their parents. AITA?I work in customer service, and the "policy” is that we’re not allowed to have our cell phones on our person at all for food safety reasons. 
The actual rule in the employee agreement is that employees can't use our cell phones while working.  My problem with leaving my cell phone in my locker is that they are accessible to the public, so hundreds if not thousands of people every day walk by them. I have also had things stolen from my locker before and management's response was "Well there are no cameras there so we can't do anything, sorry!". 

It's never been an issue till a manager noticed my phone in my pocket and told me I had to go put it in my locker. I told him respectfully that, no I wouldn't because of the reasons above.  My cell phone has two-factor authentication that I need to get into pretty much any account I have. Email, bank accounts, stocks, etc. I told him that I wasn't comfortable doing that because the potential loss of the cell phone means I wouldn't be able to access much of my personal accounts and would potentially give someone else access to them. 

My mom thinks I'm in the wrong and my dad is on my side, but I wanted someone else's opinion as well. 

So, Reddit, AITA?

Edit:  Maybe I wasn't clear enough in the original post but the written policy is that I CAN have my phone on me, I just can't use it. The managers are attempting to verbally alter/extend it to not having it on my person at all.Before my mother was born, my grandmother had a daughter that died just before she was 1 and months before my mother was born

Let's say her name was rose (traditional spelling) and mine was rosi. My mother named my first and middle name after her as an honor of her even tho my mother never met her sister. She also named me after her to cheer my grandmother up as she also had some medical disorders (I dont remember what it's called. It's the one where u act alot younger then you are. Like she would be 30 but had the mental capacity of a 10 year old). This didn't cheer my grandmother up alot but it was enough to move on with life. She was also happy I was the 1st grand kid. 

My uncle wasnt old enough to remember aunt rose either, as he was just over 2 years before she passed. He knew how to spell her name

Now I'm 20, my grandmother passed when I was 17 days away being 18. I talked to my uncle in a small family reunion ( not many family members could come). He would try calling me over using my aunt's first and middle name. I react to my first but not middle name. He would call out 'rose Marie ' when my real name was like 'rosi Mackenzie ' ( both names made up). I'd walk over and correct him and told him I prefer my 1st name not my 1st and middle name. Or her could have called me by 1st and last name as it was alotdifferent last name then aunt. He waved it off. Other family members that didnt really know me started calling me by my aunts name. 

Later, he called me by aunts name again during dinner. My mother glared at uncle. he doesnt have memory issues. It was getting  on my nerves so I spoke up. 

Me: rosi Mackenzie.  That's my name. Rose Marie was your sister. She died decades ago, just a few months before mother was born. You know what my name is, as I was at your wedding when i was 6 month old ( I was a calm baby). Idk if ur calling me rose cause of grandmother and how we realized how she was so depressed she was after her death, or to mess with me. Stop calling me with my aunts name. 

My mother and I got up and left

Aita for correcting my uncle and getting mad that hes calling me with my aunts dead name?So, in November of last year my “friend” (past drama, don’t really like her) Asked me if she could move in with my husband, baby, and I because her husband was getting deployed for six months. At the time, we needed the money and we didn’t think it would be a big deal. We had a spare bedroom and we only plan on her staying for a couple of months.

After she moved in, I realized how much I hate living with a roommate, and so did my husband. She was paying us $500 a month to stay with us and store her things in our garage. In December she decided that she was too lonely and upset and wanted to move back in with her parents eight hours away.

Wow this was frustrating, she left her stuff in our house and is paying $200 for storage. My husband was pretty mad that she moved out because we really needed the money, but we understood the emotional stress she was in.

Fast forward to yesterday, she calls me and says that she’s been kicked out of her moms house and she’s sleeping on her verbally abusive Grandma’s floor. She tells me that she wants to move back in with me, but my husband already said no.

So AITA for not letting her move back in? She says she was going to try and get an apartment with her friend down where she is..He thinks very highly of himself and is an overt. Don't get me wrong, sometimes the kid is hilarious and a charm to be around. Other times, he rubs people the wrong way and annoys them and doesn't pick up cues to knock it off. My kids have a love-hate relationship with him. When they get along, it's the greatest thing ever. When my nephew becomes annoying, it literally exasperates you. He stayed with us over the weekend and was irritating. He kept on trying to one-up everyone, complained about everything and didn't respect people's space. Eventually, he found himself all by himself in the den watching TV. He asked me where did everyone go and I told him "away." He asked why and I told him because he was "annoying." I could it hit him pretty hard. I felt bad, but he needed to hear it. My brother and SIL are useless and only enable it. But at least my nephew is starting to see it.So a bit of back story I have been working in a kindergarten as a support worker for 3 years. Now I don't have my cert in childcare but I have my cert in education support and I work alongside the teacher helping the children who need more support. Normally that means you can work in the kindy but not be counted as numbers for staff kid ratio which is fine because I'm basically one on one anyway. After three months I didn't have that certificate so I had another job lined up and my boss begged me to stay and I stayed at about $5 less than what I should even be getting but I loved my job, the staff and my director (clearly not now). Now after a while I had other job offers in which I again turned down because she didn't want to lose me. Fast forward to yesterday i get called in and told we have to let you go as it's not financially viable for me to stay and my last day would be Friday week. Than after being told that I was told I could pay my own way to study and get put in as relief staff 20 minutes after being fired, after being the key word. Not once since 2 and a half years ago has studying been brought up. They wanted to tell me a million times that they didn't want to do this but the committee made them and there was no other way. Yea clearly studying would be the other way right but they failed to mention that until long ways into the conversation and they had already fired me!  Clearly I'm not wanted so I left and proceed to tell them I cannot work another day in a place where I'm not wanted, a place that I sacrificed so much to stay to be tossed aside by a commitee that I have spoke to once in 3 years. So I came in today to clear out my locker and they offered me the cleaners job, which I kindly declined and wanted to throw me a farewell dinner like they do with all employees who leave. Why the hell would I want to have a dinner?? they fired me I didn't leave on my own terms. So I told her no I dont want a pity party and to just to maybe next time they fire someone maybe give them the options ANYTIME before telling them they no longer have a job because I would have studied and I would still be employed.For some backstory, I’ve always been obsessed with history. It started around third grade when my parents gave me a book about ancient Egypt. I was in heaven learning about their culture and practices, so started collecting trinkets of pyramids, isis, Nefertiti and anything else that reminded me of Egypt. I had notebooks filled with birth charts and family history about Pharaohs and advisers. Sometime around sixth grade I started playing a game called “Dynasty Warriors” it’s centered around Chinese history and uses real war lords as characters in the game. I was in awe! It was like history that I could be a part of, and before I knew it I was filling more notebooks with Chinese history and learning how to write my favorite characters names. I collected tea sets, fans, and pictures of geisha. As a 20yr old these things are still around my house and I love the memories they bring back. 

I’m a reserved person and rarely ever have people over to my home, however, I invited a few close friends for a movie night. They commented on the fans and ankh I have hanging on my walls and asked if they were mine. I explained that I’ve had them since childhood and adore history. We watched movies and everything was fine, but later that week one of the girls created a group chat to confront me about my appropriation of other cultures. I was shocked, I’d never want anyone to feel as if I was taking something that isn’t mine. I tried to explain that I wasn’t pretending that these cultures are in anyway mine, that I just find them interesting. But they weren’t having it and the conversation became hostile. It’s been about two weeks now and We haven’t spoken. For context they’re all white, as am I. I really don’t mind taking all of my collections down if it upsets someone, however I don’t want to be accused of something I didn’t do, by people who aren’t effected by it. I never wear traditional outfits or jewelry, it’s just trinkets around my home. Am I the asshole?So, I have a friend who, for some reason, never responds to texts... ever. Yet, when we are out to dinner, she is glued to her phone 24/7. Ive also seen her look at her phone, read a text, and not respond MANY, MANY, times, so Im sure the same is happening to me.

Anyway,  a few days ago, we texted this:

3:34pm: Her: "Hey! Thinking about you. <3 Let's catch up soon!"

3:34pm: Me:  "Hey gurl! Miss you too. Im pretty free in the evenings, are you busy at all this week?"

3:36pm: Her:  "I quit my serving job, so Im actually free all the time :P "

3:37pm: Me:  "Omg, I want to ask, but I'll save it for when we hang.... Wanna grab dinner this on Saturday night? We can even go to (favourite cocktail bar)!

\*\* 3 Days Later \*\*

Her:  "Hey sorry I forgot to respond, yeah Im free. What did you want to do?"

Me: "It took you a while to reply so I thought you werent interested, so I made plans."

Her: "Dont offer plans if you cant keep your promise."

Me: "You were responding right away, and as soon as I offered plans you went silent for 3 days? I dont get it. You do this all the time. You do this all the time, like when we went to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and even when you asked to go hiking 3 weeks ago. I can list more examples as our convo is timestamped. Be better at getting back to me, dont go silent. 

Her: \*Reacted with a thumbs up\*

\----------------------------------------

Now, this has happened time, and time, and time again. I know she's on her phone from prior behaviour, and her posting instagram stories 6 times a day. She doesnt "forget", she has a constant habit of not replying for some reason.  I used to do something similar, and from my own suspicion, she was probably checking for better plans so I feel kinda like a placeholder and Im sick of it. 

Considering she's mad at me, I still feel bad... AITA?So I had to take holidays in work or else I'd lose them so I took 10 days at once, I gave plenty of notice (1 month). 




I was 4 days into the holidays when I got a call from my boss I ignored it because I've been told to come in on my days of in the past, he called about 4 more times I ignored them all.





When I went back to work my boss was pissed he said the got unexpectedly very busy and needed my help, he told me I should have answered my phone even though I was on holidays I apologised but said I didn't have to worry about work when I'm on holiday.






Most of my colleagues think I'm right but some said I should've come in because others had to stay late.My (17F) parents (49 F&amp;M) have been divorced since 2016. My father pays roughly 1k in child support for me and my 15 M brothers (twins). I'm turning 18 in April, and going to college in the fall. My dad bought me a used car for my 17th birthday and a MacBook air for Christmas to use for college (this is relevant later). Me and my brothers visit him every other weekend, and have a decent relationship with him. I love him a lot, but he's what you could only call greedy. He's always fought my mom on child support amounts, and mentions it every time he sees our worn out shoes our our empty pantry. Even with the child support, we're barely getting by. Visiting him on his weekends with his large house and in-ground pool that he built as I was scraping up money for tuition hurts, that he could help us but won't because he hates my mom, even though he was the one who cheated and demanded a divorce. Recently, my dad has started mentioning how he will have extra money once I turn 18, because he won't have to pay child support. He called my mom today and told her that he will not be paying child support for once I turn 18, even though it states that he continues paying the flat amount until my brothers turn 18. He told her to sign the papers or he'll take it to court. We'll never be able to afford the court fees, and it hurts me deeply that he would want more fighting over giving his child money for tuition and living expenses. He says he would give it to me (maybe a little more, maybe a little less) but I'm afraid that without it being legally dictated, he'll "forget" as he has before. So, WIBTA if I told him to keep paying or lose what's left of our relationship? The reason I fear I'd be TA is because I feel as if I am putting money over our relationship, and I would regret it later.

Edit: Thank you for all your comments! It’s really helped me see things clearly. I realized I forgot to mention that he is saying the car and laptop are comparable to the money and time my mom has spent raising me. BTW I have seen the agreement, I needed it for college, as he requested he not be included in my CSS profile and the financial aid office asked for a fax of the agreement.I'm a third year law student (3L). Part of law school orientation is a huge and fatalistic talk about now that we've set foot in a law school we cannot "practice law without a license." Violating that rule could open us up to criminal liability and/or not being barred by the State Bar Association.

The school gave us specific examples of could count as "practicing law without a license," relevantly to this conversation: No reviewing or drafting contracts for your friends.

I've had friends and family push this rule a little, and for the most part they've respected it when I've said no. I'm allowed to answer hypotheticals or chime in on current legal debates or cases, but I cannot give out legal advice or services before I am barred. 

Today, a friend of mine messaged me. She works for a company but has individual clients and is drafting a contract for these one on one sessions. 

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/i77vL4C.png) is the text exchange, but if you'd rather not read the entire exchange, the TL;DR is that she wanted me to review it, I explained I could not, she explained she just wanted to "make sure it sounds good" and I still said I couldn't. Hours later, she asks again, and eventually says she asked one of our non-law student friends to look at it.

Our professional rules are pretty clear on this. All my law school friends are saying I did the right thing and if they don't understand then they're the assholes.

But I just feel bad. If she truly just wanted me to check grammar and make sure it sounded "professional" and not weigh in on the enforceability of the contract at all I feel like maybe I could argue it's not legal services? 

Part of me is also really upset at the entitlement here. Like, I've worked really hard for three years, and I'm almost to the finish line, and she ends up just pushing for free legal services? Even if I was a barred attorney there would be potential issues here (I would be the representing attorney, she would be a client, and if any of her clients disputed the contract I would have to defend it). 

I don't know. I feel like I'm not an asshole, but I also feel like I could've just looked at the damn thing, said it looks professional but "I'm not stating anything about the enforceability or legality of this contract, merely the grammar and tone" and moved on. 

So, AITA?So it's kind of more than that but I'll get into it.

A little backstory. Currently me and my fiance are renting a 1 bedroom apartment for a total of $900 a month, utilities included. We have been for the past 3 years or so. We have been offered the opportunity from his parents my FMIL (future mother in law) and FFIL( future father in law), to rent out their back apartment for $500 a month plus utilities, so that we may save up for a house. Sounds amazing and it would be if it weren't for the but in this situation, in my opinion.

Currently, my fiance's sister and BIL (brother in law), their 2 young children, and 2 very big dogs have lived there for the past 4 years or so, rent free, with free childcare and petcare given by my FMIL, FFIL and sometimes us, so that they may save up for a house which is almost finished being built. We also provide free overnight petcare for the FMIL and FFIL's 3 dogs when they go out on vacations and getaways. (Which is frequent)

Now I have no issue paying rent. I would prefer to pay rent so that we may have some say so in our living situation. Also it should be known that my fiance's parents payed their side of the rent for about a year and paid my side of the rent for 2 months, which I am paying back as I have recently accepted a pretty decent job with good pay. 

Now for the pet part.

I really want a dog or a cat. I've been wanting one for a while now but have been waiting to be financially stable. I've been making my case and bringing up how the sister and BIL have been getting away with so much for free for the past 4 years. Yet I'm not allowed to adopt a pet despite paying rent and utilities and I'm considered TA because I keep bringing up that fact. I keep being told that life isn't fair and that we're getting a great deal, which I agree with but I just want a fur baby of my own. 

AITA?

Edit***
The BIL and SIL will be moved out when we move in.
My fiance also wants to adopt.
It's my FFIL and MIL that are saying no. My SIL and BIL are saying we shouldn't have to pay rent since they didn't either.
Also the back apartment is/was a guest house. My FFIL and MIL are not landlords or pay taxes on it.

Edit*****
Thanks y'all, I wanted some unbaised opinions on this and I can see now that I've been ungrateful and inconsiderate. I can wait for a dog for a year. I have some apologizing to do.My atheist girlfriend 29F is upset on behalf of her Scientologist family that I read their confidential religious texts that people spend decades and $$$ to read.

My girlfriend 29F and I 29M have been dating for a while, she's a wonderful woman and I'd love to marry her one day.

Her family is like my family. Her brother's family are all Scientologists, they have been for decades. They're a super lovely family, who just happen to be Scientologists. They are wealthy and have invested a lot of time and money into their faith, which is very important to them.

I treat religions equally, with respect but at times critically. When I was a teenager I explored a few faiths. I read their sacred books and ended up getting baptized as a Christian. I wanted to explore the meaning of life. Christianity brings me closer to my heritage and it's a home for me to do charity work.

I'm okay with people pointing out things wrong with my Church as they're mostly correct.

I mentioned to my SO I was reading Dianetics, Scientology's entry-level book. I wanted to better understand their faith, despite the negative press. I liked the book, it's pretty conversational, half of it is self-help, the other half is fictional science.

Her brother had gifted $50k in courses for her but she politely decided it wasn't for her shortly into it. She was cool with me reading Dianetics but requested I do not read the sensitive content that is in other books reserved for higher members - this content is leaked online and most know it roughly.

On the cover of Dianetics, it has an illustration of a volcano with an explosion. It's a reference to their creation myth, which is only revealed to high-level adherents in this sensitive content.

It's super confidential, and Scientologists think non-adherents can get ill from reading it. I'm pretty curious so I ignore my partner's advice (I know, quite disrespectful) and go online and read it anyway.

I won't disclose the content but all I'll say is it's rather imaginative. I even read up to the last stage but I won't spoil it for you. - EDIT the concerning part is the highest level stuff is literally about bringing back the anti-christ.

INFO, I pirated this as they aren't able to be purchased online and if I purchased in person or with my card, they would constantly send mail like they do my SO.

I disclosed to my SO I read the sensitive content - I felt guilty. I also wanted to reflect on how Christianity in a way is as far fetched. She's outraged I would violate her trust like this. She explained it would be like reading her diary after being instructed to not do so.

I do agree it's disrespectful but if someone left a book that had written on it, DO NOT READ, MEANING OF LIFE INSIDE, I'd try and read it. I like reading, particularly texts related to different cultures.

I've apologized and promised not to investigate further. She stated that this will basically destroy my relationship with her brother and has made her question my respect for her. My relationship with her and her family is important and I simply wanted to better understand their faith and I was genuinely curious.

On one hand, she's right, it's disrespectful. One the other hand, I think I've been more than open-minded given the nature of their faith (I'm reasonably well informed about the negative press). So my question here is, am I the asshole?

Note my girlfriend's parents are Christian and she's wanted any kids she has be raised as Christian. The OT8 secret documents, the final level are about welcoming the anti-christ so it's kind of incompatible to her parents and my faith.So I’m a bartender at a large chain restaurant. After a certain point in the night the bartenders are responsible to handle the take out orders as well. A girl a little younger than me (26F) comes in to pick up an order. I tell her the price, she hands me the money, I count it, and she’s a penny short. I tell her “you’re short a penny, do you have one?” And she rudely snaps back “no” and starts digging through her purse. I just stand there waiting for her to keep looking, and she tells me she doesn’t have one or any other change. She gets a huge attitude and says to me “you’re telling me that you don’t have one WHOLE penny back there than you can give me??? You don’t have a single penny????” And I say “only in my tips” and she snatches the change out of my hand and hands me a $10 bill to cover the rest. When I give her her change she throws 3 pennies onto the bar and says “here now you have some extras” and then says to me “go check on my order”. Now don’t get me wrong... I know it’s EXTREMELY petty to make a big deal over a penny. I honestly always look out for regulars or polite customers and hook them up whenever I can. If the girl had handed me the change and said “hey, I’m short a penny- do you have an extra one you could cover me?” I would have gladly done it. But she was just so rude and entitled from the start by assuming that i would pay her extra penny that I didn’t want to do anything to help her. But I still realize it was over 1¢ which I know sounds like an AH move. So reddit.... AMITA??I cannot stand Josh. His girlfried Mimi says he has anxiety and depression but I think he's spoiledt/entitled.

Josh barely graduated college due to videogames. Since graduation he’s worked for 2 years and was unemployed for 4.

While unemployed, he tried to take classes at a community college but didnt attend classes. When his lease ended and his complex didn’t want to renew, he asked his parents for help. They told him he could move back with them if he got a part time job, or enrolled in a master degree program (that they would pay for). He was so insulted he said he’d rather be homeless and live in his car. Because apparently his parents should’ve accepted him back unconditionally, therefore they didn’t love him.

Mimi decided they could move in together and did all the apartment hunting WHILE she was working. Josh didn’t help. Mimi found a new place, signed everything, figured out how to move and furnish everything while he sat home unemployed. She’d ask him to be at home for furniture deliveries, but he’d be playing games and wouldn’t get the door.

Mimi says hes anxious and depressed, but a good guy on the inside. That he has trouble getting motivated, has low confidence, is afraid of failing, and just wants to love and be loved.

She’s been good for him and helping him to become a normal human. He’s FINALLY gotten a job and held it for about a year now. He occasionally does the dishes without being told.

But Mimi still does everything else. Cooking, cleaning, laundry, keeping the house stocked. Josh occasionally does some cleaning, brings home free food from work, and thinks he’s contributing.

All our friends smile and talk about how much he’s improved (oh wow, he volunteered to wash the dishes once this week! How amazing!). They even have tactics to help him when he flips out over stupid shit like being asked to help cook. He storms out of the house to us. And we listen to him whine about how hard his life is, how Mimi doesn’t respect him, or how no one understands just how much harder he has it until he calms down enough to go home. Meanwhile Mimi waits for him and they talk it over and she makes some compromise about how she understands his feelings and she’ll try better.

Everyone thinks this is great progress. I’m sitting there with a forced smile wondering if they’re all crazy for coddling this damn 30 year old manchild or if I’m being the insensitive and unsupportive one. I get he need supportive friends if he’s depressed, but this seems excessive. They’re praising him for doing the bare minimum of being a 30 year old man.

Am I being too hard on him? Apparently he’s been reading self-help books and trying to make an effort. But each time I see him do a basic adulting task and everyone acting like he’s volunteered to donate a kidney makes me want to roll my eyes.

IDK reddit, help me see the other side. AITA because I don't have a single ounce of compassion for Josh even though hes depressed?So my daughter and her friends went to a local shitty dive bar near our house, we know the owners and the owners family. 

One of the bartenders(guess was being moody) there accused my daughters boyfriend of having a fake ID because it’s an out of state ID. 

He ended up showing his military ID bc he is military and the bartender still gave them hell over it and even cussed them out.

My wife is angry with me for still going to the bar(like I said we are friends with the owners)and giving them business. The owners were sorry for it. 

Edit: the bartender was being rude to them and cussed them both out, for detail. 

AITA for this?I think this is totally ridiculous, but it’s pretty split amongst the people on my floor. Basically I (F19) was roommates with this girl (F19), we’ll call her Emily. I say *was* roommates because soon after this all hell broke loose and we got housing involved to find us new roommates (we’re in college). 

Basically, we started out as great friends. A particular thing to note is i am one of the rare freshmen with a car on campus, so a lot of the time I would drive Emily and her friends to target whenever they wanted to get food or supplies and stuff like that (like *bandaids*)

One day we are organizing our room and she tells me ‘oh hey alakaiex by the way i have a first aid kit for us! It’ll be right here in my top drawer under my bed if you ever need it’. 

A week or two later I’m talking with a friend from down the hall (sort of a mutual friend between me and Emily), and he messed up his foot pretty bad and it’s bleeding. I offer to get him a bandaid and grab it from the first aid kit (just one bandaid). Later that night Emily is back in the room and I ask her if I could take a cough drop from the first aid kit. She tells me oh yeah go ahead it’s in the— and I start to cut her off and say oh yeah don’t worry I remember, I had to get a bandaid earlier today. 

She gets quiet and thirty seconds later she starts saying ‘don’t you EVER go through my drawers EVER again’, and I’m very confused and the rest of the conversation goes like this:

Me: what are you talking about? You said the first aid kit was for us. 

Emily: but they were in MY drawers

Me: but you told me EXACTLY where it was and said I could use it if I ever needed anything 

Emily: clearly i meant you had to ASK first

Me: i understand that now, but you were in class, and someone was bleeding, besides, you EXPLICITLY told me I could use it. (I didn’t say this but what was I supposed to do, let him bleed till her four hour lab was over??). 
 
It went on for a bit. Part of her reasoning was that she would want to know if she needed to replace any supplies, which is reasonable, but it was one bandaid, and I wouldn’t take more without telling her. Also, i think it’s crazy to accuse me of going through her stuff if she explicitly tells me I could use the first aid kit *that she keeps in her drawers*. AITA here?I'm a high school Senior, and our school has a pretty strict "no phone policy", where teachers who actually bother to give a shit would take students' phones if they ever saw you use it around campus.

Most teachers only enforce this policy to the younger kids, but seniors aren't as monitored. Some teachers are fine with us using our phones in our breaks.

Last week, my dad bought me a new iPhone 11 Max Pro. He told me it's my gift for getting accepted into college, and I was genuinely happy about it. Today I was using my phone after I got a text from my mom, who was at the time in the grocery store. She asked me if I wanted anything in particular for dinner, so I was messaging her about what I wanted, until my dean shows up, telling me to give her my phone immediately.

I ask her to wait one second so that I can at least complete my text to my mom, and as I was about to, she snatches the phone away from my hand and begins ridiculing me about how I am a senior and I should know better, how I should be a role model to the kids, etc etc. I apologize to her to get out of the situation as fast as possible, because nobody likes my dean and doesn't want to deal with her.

As she snaps away and starts walking, she drops my phone on the ground. As soon as I saw what happened, I rushed to my phone to see the screen visibly cracked. At the anger of the moment, I call her a "fucking bitch".

She immediately goes off on how dare I say such things to her, you get it, I'm obviously mad, so I snap at her again saying something along the lines of "If you cant hold something, maybe you shouldn't take it". When I arrive home, my parents confront me about how they received an email from the school about my "intolerable actions" towards my teachers. I explained to them what happened, and they told me that the will complain to the school about it, but that I shouldn't talk to my teacher like that.

So am I the asshole for calling my dean a bitch?Throwaway account. So I've had to move in with my sister (who lives with her husband and her 3 kids) about 2 months ago due to financial trouble and mental health stuff that I've been having to deal with.  I'm in the process of selling my old house, so I asked my sister if I could keep my hamster at her place, to which she agreed. However the problem is that I've been the only one who's been cleaning the cage and making sure it has been fed, even though everyone in the house seems to be enjoying it and playing with it.

I've recently been spending a lot of time at my old place packing and working on getting it into selling condition, so naturally I've been feeling tired and exhausted, so I asked my sister if she could take care of the cage for this week, to which she said she was also to tired and to try asking one of her kids. I texted them and each one of them gave excuses about how they couldn't (either too busy with school or work, etc). I got fed up and called them out about how I've been the only one taking care of him, to which they all said it was my hamster and therefore my responsibility. My POV is that they agreed to let me keep the hamster here, so they should help out with the cleaning and maintenance every now and then, especially since they're enjoying its company. AITA?Last night I was texting this girl I've been seeing for a little while. We talk basically every day, we've both decided a friends with benefits type scenario works best for us. We've gotten really close though, which we both know is dangerous but neither of us really want a relationship. We talk often and we're really open about how we're feeling. 

I'm about 7 months fresh off getting dumped by my girlfriend of 5 years. It's no excuse, but that's done a lot to shake my self worth and a lot of times it gets in the way of my new friendships/relationships. I overthink things a lot and often times make up whole scenarios in my head based on feelings that really just come from my own bullshit.

This girl has a very different texting style than my ex did and it's taking me some getting used to. A lot of times we'll be on snap using the text feature on there and just messaging back and forth in real time. A lot of times she just kind of dips out of nowhere for an hour or two, which is totally cool. I need to be better about not letting that hurt my feelings, but last night I wasn't very good about that. 

Last night basically we were texting like I explained above and she just disappeared. And it really kinda made me a little upset at the time. She does it a lot and never really says "Hey I gotta go for a few I'll talk to ya later" or whatever. I want to clarify that this isn't what I'm upset about now, she has no obligation to fulfill my idea of what she should do.

But at the time it got to me and when she got back to messaging me I'd intentionally take time to reply or just be kind of removed from the conversation. I didn't want to be super invested in it if it didn't feel like she was. In my mind I was trying to match her energy.

After a while of this she asked, "Hey, are you good?", and like it took me a second but I realized how I was being kind of ridiculous. I apologized and like tried explaining it but she was really short in her responses. She understandably was upset, and I was like trying to rationalize it. 

In the middle of things though she just said, "okay, well I'm gonna go to bed." and that was sort of it.

It's around 3 pm my time, her and I usually text all day but neither of us have all day. Through typing this I've kind of realized that I am the asshole because this all kind of stemmed from me in the first place. 

I'm still really upset that she just kind of left it but I understand why she would. It's just that I'm having a hard time figuring out how to approach it. I know she won't message me first so I feel responsible to kind of strike up the conversation and apologize, but I think I'd just be saying the apology I tried to say last night that she didn't want to hear.

I feel ridiculous. I wasn't always like thisOur neighbors have two Shepherd puppies that they leave outside locked in a crate all day and all night while they are at work. A few weeks ago the dogs escaped out of the crate and dug out from under the fence I caught the dogs and because I was alone I notified the police to come and help and when The neighbor found out she got really upset with me and told me to mind my business and leave her dogs alone. Over Valentine's day weekend it was really raining where we are and they had left the dogs out from that Friday afternoon until Tuesday morning in the rain nobody hardly paid any attention to them. Sunday morning at 3:30 in the morning the dogs were locked in their kennel and they were whining and crying and yelping and they sounded as if they were in distress we called the police and they didn't do anything so we filed a report with animal control. animal control struggled all week to try to touch base with the owners of these dogs and they finally made contact on a Thursday that Friday night we had the police at our house saying the neighbor feels like we're harassing her. here we are about 2 weeks later and we're heading into some cold weather for our area and we know those dogs are going to be locked outside all weekend and there's more rain in the forecast. Would I be the AH if she leaves the dogs out in the rain all weekend and the dogs sound as if they are distress to report it again? I'm stuck because I don't want problems but the dogs also keep me up all night barking despite measures to drown the sound. I feel like the AH already.Certain smells or chemicals have always made it difficult for me to breathe, especially if they are in spray form.  This includes hairspray, Lysol, and some perfumes.  Several months ago, we got a new employee who uses hairspray every morning when she comes in.  I asked her as politely as I could to please leave the light on after using it.  She left it on one time.  I thought she just had trouble remembering, so I made a sign two days ago and put it on the door.  It didn't seem rude to me, it just said, "Please leave the light on if you have used any kind of spray." When I went into the bathroom this morning, the sign was crumpled up and thrown in the trash.  I asked if she did that, and I don't think my tone was aggressive or accusatory.  She snapped at me, saying, "Yeah I did, 'cause it's childish!  This ain't fourth grade!  I'm not even using that bathroom anymore! I asked (HR) and they said I can use the one upstairs."  I muttered something under my breath about how that's a good thing if she can't be considerate.  I went back to my desk feeling very angry. 

I was already annoyed when this happened, because the first two doors I tried to open when I arrived this morning were locked, because the one guy with a key can't be bothered to unlock any door besides the one he needs to get in, and it was very windy today. I probably shouldn't have said anything about thinking that I should be trusted with a key sine I've been working there so long.  

Anger makes me cry, which is embarrassing, so I asked my immediate supervisor if we could talk, and he asked me if I needed to take a personal day (I have three weeks of vacation time, because I worked there almost 11 years) and while I was driving home, he called me to let me know that they were letting me go.  He told me that they decided that this was a good time, because I was caught up so far with my work, and this is the slow season. They won't need to have anyone take over my job for a couple of months.

Did I do something wrong by asking people to be considerate?I recently moved to a new home with my two cats. The neighbor asked me not to let my cats outside because they will ruin the bird habitat she has created. She’s not wrong. Her yard is a bird haven with fountains, feeders, and houses. It seems like her entire yard is a tribute to her love of birds. However, my cats are indoor outdoor cats with NO EXCEPTIONS. They are healthy, have all their shots, and have their routines. I refuse to make my cats miserable due to her love of wild birds. I told her to put some cat repellent in her yard. I’m more than happy to pay for it. But she seems to think that by the sheer presence of the cats so close to her yard they will not return. I want her, my cats, and I to be happy. AITA for telling her (nicely) tough titty said the kitty?This guy I knew for a while, we started hanging out last summer and I caught the feels (I’m a gay male which he knew), he said it was ok and we became even better friends. He started hanging out with this woman all the time which I was a lil bitter about but shit happens. Slowly turned into a mess. Won’t let him go anywhere without her, she doesn’t work, and she’s severely bipolar to the point she drives him absolutely insane sometimes. He can do whatever he wants honestly, go ahead. Was still going to his house and hanging out with them all the time. But there’s times when I go there and immediately feel unwelcome, in HIS house, because of her. I thought I was just being bitter until our other friends said they felt the same way. I’m not exaggerating when I say she makes our entire friend group uncomfortable. He’s mentioned to me that she’s bitched about me and him hanging out because I’m gay, another time it was because he hangs out with his friends too much (which he does not), and another time because she thinks I’m judging her. The last time she blew up at him I could tell something was up for a few days, he came and vented to me I went off about how she sucks. He invited me over the next day and they were unloading the car full of her stuff she packed up the day before. She’s manipulative and he don’t care. 

I snapped him the next day and told him I can’t be around her for a while. I said I’m sorry, hope you’re not mad, hangout with us soon. He says all good,and have a good night. So the next day, he invites me over, get to his house and she’s there... I’m already in the driveway so I come in the house for 10 minutes and find a reason to leave. Snap him again asking if I was or wasn’t clear, he says “hmmm, I’m confused” so I resent the snap I saved. Then he goes off about how he’s sorry he’s going to fix the problem, we both feel the same way, etc. I went off on him again about how much she sucks and I have bit my tongue for far too long, feeling unwelcome in HIS house because of HER, etc.

We still snapped every day, finally talked in person yesterday. He told me that she asked about me because she could tell that something was up, that I haven’t been coming over every day for the last 2 weeks like I usually do. Told him that she never sat right with me (which is true, knew her sister long before), she bitches about me and there’s ALWAYS going to be something wrong. I don’t pretend to like people, never have, did it this time because he’s my friend. I could tell he was sad about it, and I honestly feel horrible, but... I can’t keep up that facade.

I work in healthcare, I know how bipolar disorder works. I have my own mental health issues. I cannot handle other people’s severe issues when they interfere with my own life, so I didn’t see any other way than to step away from her. So... am I the asshole?Without giving away a heap of details I work for a Univeristy and as part of a project we donate a lot of physical materials to a local social enterprise. This accounts for around 25k for them each year with no end in site and we donate to them exclusively. We have had a relationship with them for about 5 years and it's great.

This week we asked them if they would run a workshop for us (they teach people upcycling skills) for about 20 employees. They have qouted me around 700 quid, which is my entire budget for outreach projects for the year. Usually it goes to catering and we get guest speakers in and do an odd site visit somewhere.

I dont want to kick up a fuss and I am aware of appearing as a Choosing Beggar but I was perturbed a little.My friend Em and I have been close for almost 2 decades, growing up together and in our adulthood despite our far proximity we’ve remained close. In the last few years, we both found ourselves going through difficult divorces and connected even more over it. My divorce didn’t involve any children but Em’s involved the son she shares with her ex. Over the past year, Em continues to struggle with everything from making rent on time, to staying employed, to coparenting with her ex. My life has relatively stabilized but I’m still facing a lot of legal troubles stemming from my ex stealing my identity and me having to prove that I was not involved with his illegal dealings. Several times a month, Em calls me to vent about her situation and I follow up in a day or two after doing some research urging her to contact specific community services that may be able to help her though she never does. The problem is that during the last 6 months or so she refuses to reciprocate. I have tried talking to her multiple times about the stress my ex has put me under because I know she can relate but she keeps cutting me off to say that I’m triggering her and she can’t help me. I am very aware that hearing these sorts of details can be very triggering (I go through that myself every time she calls) but I think it’s unfair that I do my best to help her when she refuses to help me. I don’t want to leave her alone and unsupported, but it’s taking a large emotional toll on me. WIBTA if I cut her off from my emotional help?I live in a college dorm, and the dorms are set up like apartments. It's 4 to an apartment, with a living room, kitchen, and a bathroom, and each person gets their own bedroom. The people above us will party until 2 am every day of the week, slamming on the floors, jumping around, and other such nonsense. I have to be up for class at 5 am. Me and my other roommates have complained to the campus police, the resident's assistants, everybody. They know they're being ridiculously loud, they laugh about it in class. So last night I waited until they had just fallen asleep, and started slamming on the ceiling right above their bedrooms, until I heard them start stomping around.

Edit: this has been going on for months on their part. We've taken it to every authority figure we have on campus. Nothing has been done about it.
Edit 2: My roommates are out of town for the week.
Edit 3 it took me forever to realize my grammar mistake regarding slamming the ceiling. I'm not changing it out of shame.I’m pretty young, but one of my friends is already married and has a 4yo daughter. I think she’s a good mom, she’s a good person, but there’s been some things bothering me and my best friend for a while. I know that it’s rude to attempt to tell someone how to parent their kid or what they’re doing is wrong, especially if you don’t have kids yourself, but I felt like this needed to be said. When we all hang out, her daughter is usually comes over too. This makes it feel weird to drink and have a good time, since there’s a tiny human around. Usually I’m the one who may only have 1 drink, then I’ll spend the evening entertaining her and playing. Which sucks, because I want to relax and hang out with my friends. 

Whenever she’s fed up, she’ll give her her “sleepy juice” to make her go to sleep. It’s not just before bed, it can be in the middle of the day, and when she wants her to sleep she’ll give it to her. Not only that, if she doesn’t give her melatonin sometimes this kid will stay up really late with us while everyone is drinking and saying/doing whatever, and she even plays beer pong. Beer pong! Granted there’s only usually like 6-7 of us around, but me and my best friend have been side eyeing this parenting for a good year now. 
So I finally said something. I tried to approach it lightly. I said “hey, maybe she could stay with your parents next time you come over or something, you could relax better?” And she said no, she wants her to be with her. So I said, what if she accidentally gets into some beer or something? That’s really dangerous. She rolled her eyes and said that she was fine, and it went back and forth for a while before we got into a legitimate argument and I basically told her that it’s shitty that she gives her kid medicine to make her sleep when she’s done with her, so why shouldn’t she go to her grandparents instead? And, of course, shit hit the fan. I feel bad, but I didn’t know how else to bring up the fact that a four year old shouldn’t be playing beer pong or being knocked out by melatonin.I'm 23 and moved out at 18, i have paid the entirety of my schooling/bills the whole way. I have a bartender job so i owe alot of money at the end of the year if i don't claim the money i spent on school. My dad wants to claim me as a dependent and claim the money i spent on school so he gets more back. On one hand i understand they took care of me for 18 years and i dont want to be selfish but i know if i do not claim my school i will owe thousands in taxes that i do not have. WIBTA if i told him i want to claim what i did?

Edit: Thanks everyone for your advice/ judgement!  i definetly thought this was gonna be majority YTA but soon realized i am definetly not.My husband and brother in law own a house together. In the beginning of the summer my brother in law got his friend and his girlfriend to move in to our house. They were very friendly and helped for a bit but they eventually stopped, now I'm pretty much the only one who does work around here. I dont mind cleaning after my husband and brother in law since they're family, but not them. Every once in a while I do ask the roommates to do a chore but they literally NEVER take the initiative and on the contrary, they leave messes.

Now the juicy part. A couple weeks after they moved in, there was a night where me, my husband and the cam girl were home. Our house is a 4 story split I believe it's called so we went upstairs to the kitchen (mainfloor) for snacks but as soon as we got there we could hear the girlfriend moaning, loudly. Were stood in the kitchen, frozen in shock for a moment but then I was one of the angriest I've ever been. I dont remember what happened much anymore (bad memory and my brain was also going crazy then) but basically I wanted to going go break her door down and ruin her day or something. My husband managed to calmed me down enough to just forget it and leave. Afterwards, my husband and I made the realization that shes a cam girl. We each heard her moan then say "oh thank you Ben103817" or some random user name like that. She also has a webcam and lights pointed to their bed. Their room is directly beside the only bathroom and they leave their door wide open so we just saw it. We also heard them talking about it during a party that they had here.

We try our best to ignore it, sometimes I knock loudly on the walls of their hallway to get her to notice shes loud. It quiets her down a bit and only for a short period of time. She also isnt as loud anymore as the first time but it's still very obvious since these walls are made of paper. I'm slowly losing my patience and I've started to yell at her to shut up. I've asked her boyfriend to tell her to be quieter atleast when we are upstairs making food or watching a movie. He said "it's her job" and "we could say the same about you" but its uncomfortable cooking food while listening to her go for hours. I get that we do things that bother them, such as our puppy who can be obnoxious sometimes and he barks at everything. Were trying to train him to stop and hes gotten very good but it's still an on going problem. My husband and I both go to school so we cant really stop our dog if he barks at something for a bit. My argument is that they agreed to live here aware of the puppy. I hate everything about her and her boyfriend. I cant help it. They dont help, they bother me, and they're loud. I'm just so confused if it's wrong that I feel this way. I've tried to be patient with the whole situation in order to not have drama between all of us since we are all living together but I just cant take it anymore. Am I the asshole?Hey everybody.

So on Saturday I'm hosting Dungeons and Dragons for my friends. Today I learned that one of my friends, is the neighbour of the first confirmed case of the Corona virus (Patient zero) in my country, Denmark. 

I have complete trust in my government to quarantine my friend, if they believe that they might have been in risk of contracting the Corona virus as well.

My wife wants me to cancel Dungeons and Dragons regardless, because of a very important audit at her job. AITA for wanting to continue as planned?

&#x200B;

TL;DR Friend is neighbour of corona virus patient zero. My wife wants me to cancel game night.



EDIT: I've been able to set up a way, for my friend to Skype in.So, to put it shortly, he cheated and did a bunch of drugs while I was in the hospital and I left him. He hasn’t seen our daughter since almost a month before because my health issues meant I couldn’t take care of her and he refused. So since about august 1st of last year, since I left him in September. Well he never stopped doing drugs and frequently posts on social media about the drugs he’s doing. 
Anyway he says he wants some visitation but has no idea when and is too busy buying said drugs to help financially(weed and coke from what mutuals have told me). I said ok because it would mean he’s trying but he keeps making excuses. I want to cut him out but I’ve decided to wait until our daughter is old enough to make that choice. She will be 2 next month and he says that he’s not going to try and see her. 
Am I the asshole for telling him he can’t see her unless he passes a drug test?
AITA for telling my ex’s crush about their social media posts?


Cast:
Ex: Dated for 6 months
Best friend: Knows me and Ex and is childhood best friends with crush
Crush: The longtime crush of ex, I know her pretty well

I went on my first date with Ex January of 2019, it went amazing. Afterwards and plenty of talking, I asked her to be my girlfriend, she said yes, but later took it back. I kept being friends with her. A month later I find out that Ex has used me as a rebound to get over Crush. Now, me and Crush don’t look alike, we’re both fair skinned, tall, with brown hair. A contrast that will be important later is that I’m skinny, and Crush is thicker. My ex is thick as well.

I spent the rest of the time being friends with Ex, still crushing on her. Then we dated officially at August of 2019, and things started to die out around Christmas time. Then things really died in January. She asked me to not hold hands with her, and all affection was lost. Finally a week before Valentine’s Day I had it, I ended things on a Friday. Ex seemed... overjoyed. I was happy initially because no nasty breakup.

Well, come Saturday and I see it. 5 posts on a public side account of my Ex. She wrote poetry, one about liking ‘chubby’ girls. And others giving very descriptive writings that were clearly about Crush. I was furious. I posted nothing and remained respectful, she made it seem that she was pining for Crush our entire relationship.

The end of friendship was nasty. She initiated a public and very loud argument with me when I didn’t even look at her (she walked up to me). I told Best Friend because... duh best friend. Now Best Friend was honestly more angry than I was. She mentioned wanting to tell Crush about everything, I was originally against it because I didn’t want to ruin Ex’s love life. Come to find out Best Friend told her anyway.

Best friend said that Crush was weirded out, and said she had no feelings for Ex whatsoever.

Now, I spoke to Crush because we do know each other and have for 5 years. I sent her an apology about her involvement in the entire situation. She said that she felt sorry for what happened and mentioned that what Ex wrote was creepy and made her uncomfortable.

I followed Crush’s private account and saw many posts about her eating disorder and very personal notes about her appearance. But it was mostly about her weight. She mentions starving herself quite often, but I have been told by Best Friend that is receiving help for this but it still makes her feel terrible. Ex was pretty much fetishizing Crush while taking a jab at me for being stick thin. 

So AITA for letting this happen? I felt guilty about ruining Ex’s love life initially, but weirdly not anymore. I think Ex is shitty. But Ex justifies herself by the following:

-“We’re not together anymore”
-“I’ve been over you for a long time now”
-“I wasn’t not into you!”
-“you can’t leave me, you’re my only friend.”Just to preface, I understand that if I'm asking someone to go out of their way as well as use their gas and time I should pay them. A friend of mine is going home over the weekend and offered to give me a ride since we live in the same town. The last time she brought me home I gave her $20 to drive me home despite only asking $5 if nothing. Im a bit short on cash and don't feel like I should pay so much if she isn't really going out of her way to take me back as well. Would I be the asshole for not paying as much as last time?

EDIT: Many people say I'm an asshole for not wanting to pay anything when the last sentence says "would I be the asshole for not paying *AS MUCH* as last time". I'm of course paying something but some people got lazy and didn't read the whole postSo I went to the eye doctor and ordered new contacts. They placed my order to a third party who then mailed me the contacts. One of the boxes was the incorrect prescription (my eyes have two different Rxs, yay) so I called them and they told me they would order me the correct box and I would have to come in the office to switch it out. Well, a few days ago I get another shipment from the third party with a whole year's worth of contacts and the correct Rx. WIBTA if I just kept them? The only reason I'm even considering this is because a) I'd have to drive over there to give them back and I will have to take off work to do so and b) they gave me a voucher for a $75 rebate that didn't even work.

So give me my judgment and just know that either way there is a 95% chance I will end up calling the eye doctor to return them because I already feel kinda bad that I've kept them this long.My dog Koda died last year and my grandma who raises him, told him that Koda left and will come back later, he’s 5 years old and while I don’t want to go in depth about it but I just don’t want him to have his hopes up because he loved Koda so much 

Everytime we go to a store my cousin asks if we can get a toy for when Koda comes back. Yeah.... it’s hard to watch.so a while ago my friends started not inviting me anywhere and still planning stuff right in front of me without asking me if i wanted to come and when i asked they said its exclusive or some shit

so i asked a couple people who are my actual good friends if theyve heard something said about me behind my back because i felt like its possible

and when they said yes i confronted the person who said shit and it took awhile for him to admit it but when he did he tried to help himself by saying that others have too and if i wanna know who i have to tell who told me and i aint a snitch so i wasnt gonna say

after that i asked a few of our other friends if they know anything about this and if theyve been saying something about me

and they said no and i was like aight cool thanks

but then the guy who i first asked called me a fucking shitty ass person for doing that since one of the people asked apparently told him and he just continued to call me names and eventually asked if we can be cool and im so confused because hes the one who started getting mad at me
So while I still lived with my parents I would work on cars. Sometimes just working on my own or making a little money by fixing my friends and our neighbors.

When I was in high school my sisters husband died while she was pregnant. She needed our parents help with watching her kids so she and her older son, John, moved in.

My mom also watched my brothers daughter, Jane. 

 I wasn’t the most involved uncle, but while I was working on cars in the driveway they would get curious and ask me what I was doing and offer to help. Over the years I ended up teaching them a few things and it became our thing.

Eventually though I graduated from college and moved away up north.

when John graduated from high school I thought I’d go down to see the ceremony and see everyone.

At the time I had a guy that would sell me cars really cheap. They needed to be fixed up a lot, but most of the cost of fixing them was labor which I could do myself. I’d buy them all the time and flip the cars for extra money.

Since the working on cars thing was really the only connection I had to John I decided to give him one of the cars I was working on for graduation.

Later when Jane graduates I did the same thing as she was also part of the car thing.

Now 7 years later my other nephew, David. The one that my sister was pregnant with when she moved back into our parents is graduating. I heard through my parents that’s he’s also expecting a car from me. 

But I wasn’t planning on getting one for him. I wasn’t actually planning on going to his graduation at all. My wife and I are expecting our first child around that time and she obviously doesn’t want to travel and I don’t want to be that far from her. 

Plus spending money on travel or a really big present isn’t something we can do right now. I no longer have the connection to the guy who would sell me cheap cars. I’m not actually even working on cars now since we’re living in an apartment until we can save up for a down payment for a house.

I’m thinking this might go pretty bad when I tell them though. David is mildly autistic, From what I’ve heard from my parents he has moments where he can lose control of his emotions, but I don’t know him, so I can’t be sure.This is on behalf of my friend. 

My friend, let’s call him P found pictures of his sister on my other friends, let’s call him B, iPad. P was scrolling through B’s iPad and went onto his recently deleted where he found questionable screen shots of his younger sisters Instagram on his recently deleted. P assumed B was beating his meat to them as there was other porn in the recently deleted alongside pictures of his sister. B was in the room while P was on his iPad and P, scared of confront B just deleted the pictures permanently and confided in me. We had a week off school and P confronted B. B completely denied allegations and said someone else must’ve done it because people are on his iPad all the time. Me and P find this hard to believe but someone came forward saying it was them. B and that person are friends therefore there is a high chance that B asked that person to say this. P is now avoiding B and refusing to talk to him. P and B were very very close friends before this.

Also I must mention that Ps sister is 16 and the legal age of consent where I’m from is 16. We are all 17 / just turned 18

Is P the asshole for cutting of ties with B.

EDIT: the main point of Bs argument against this was that nobody should’ve been snooping on his iPad in the first place. This is obviously alongside him claiming it wasn’t him.I (21F) met her (24F) at a youth fellowship at the start of the new academic year; I had just transferred here for my final year, she had been here her entire course. We started attending the fellowship every Friday - normally she texts me earlier in the week to check if I want to put my name down for the carpool list and we make plans from there, it's kinda a habit to expect her text asking whether I'm "going this Friday" now. 

Now normally the fellowship has dinner together before Bible study where everyone splits the bill and it's honestly the highlight of my week after Sunday afternoons where I go out to lunch with the same friend. Since the new year however they've omitted the dinner part and it's just plain old Bible study, which I have to admit loses a lot of my interest. Another fact that will become relevant soon is that I have a competition this Saturday starting 8.30am (the fellowship meetings usually end at 10pm and it's close to 11pm when I get home after carpooling and everything). I was meeting with my teammates for a final prep session on Friday afternoon. Neither of this I've told her, it just never came up.

So she texts me again and this time I text her back to see if she's going; we missed the previous two weeks because one of us was busy and the other decided might as well skip then. She says she is, I then explain the competition thing and that I might have to miss this week's but to tell the fellowship I'll be there next week.

She simply replies "ok".

It's not uncommon for her to give short replies, this one was just... a bit too short. I follow up asking whether she plans to eat dinner at home before heading to the carpool meetup location, she says "probably". I then suggest we can grab dinner nearby as it's within walking distance of both the library where I'm prepping with my team and the carpool meetup, but I'm okay with whatever she decides.

She leaves me on seen.

I spend the next hour glancing at my notif-free phone while doing schoolwork, until it hits me that the previous Sunday we'd ran into someone from the fellowship who said they missed seeing us and hoped we could make it this week. It was a brief five minute interaction and I remember we did talk about getting dinner together before fellowship, but with everything that's happened this week I had no memory of it until now. After some agonising text drafting I finally text her asking her to text me back when she's available so I can call her; the message is delivered but not read, so she's offline.

I wouldn't have thought much about this had she not told me off the same Sunday mentioned above for biking recklessly on the main road after I'd forgotten to wait at a crossroads and ridden ahead as a car rounded the corner and narrowly missed me. Now I'm worried she thinks of me as a forgetful and dismissive friend on top of being irresponsible. On the other hand both of us have had turns before at changing Friday night plans after originally intending to go to fellowship.I'm currently taking a class at my local college.  The class is MWF but last Monday was a holiday so the first day of class was last Wednesday.  I attended the first day of class but it was packed so I had to stand in the back.  Then I missed the Friday lecture as well as the Monday lecture.  Today, Wednesday, was my 1st day back. I knew the class was packed so I came 10 min early to get a seat in the front row.  I prefer to sit in the front row because I have anxiety.  By sitting in the front I'm able to ask questions/answer questions without being forced to shout it across the room.  I'm perfectly capable of doing well in a course if I'm forced to sit in the back...this is just a strong preference.

All seats are first come, first served.  There are 2 seats in each class called "priority seats" specifically designated for the disabled that are only open to abled students when they're unoccupied.  You have to notify the school, then the professor makes sure that seat is available to you every lecture. For the abled seats, after a few weeks people always tend to sit in the same seats and you get the impression that its your "seat" that you sit in for the rest of the semester even though its technically not.  After I sit down I notice 2 girls walk in together talking and laughing.  One girl sits in the seat behind me and the other girl stands next to me and says:

Girl 1: Hi, sorry, actually you're sitting in my seat.

Me: There is no assigned seating.  Anyone can sit anywhere.

Girl 1: Yeah but I've been sitting in this seat all semester (this is our 3rd lecture out of like 30). There are still open seats in the back that you can move to.

Me: Which means there are also open seats in the back that you can sit in too, right?

Girl 1: Look...I'm deaf in 1 ear. I need a seat in the front row.  Move please. (I saw her hearing aid)

Me: Then you'd be registered with the disabled students department and they would have made sure you had priority seating. This isn't a priority seat.

Girl 1: I don't need to register anything with the school and I dont need to explain myself to you.  Its my seat...I told you I need it because I'm hard of hearing.

Me: Wouldn't those same rules apply to me as well? Not needing to explain myself to you?

Girl 2: Stop being an asshole and just fucking move...jesus.

Me: I'm done talking. I'm not moving.

Girl 1 and Girl 2: \*\*scoffs\*\*

Girl 1: \*\*finds another seat\*\*

I don't feel like I did anything wrong, but I damn sure spent the rest of class overhearing everyone behind me talking shit about me. It's important to point out that we're always given worksheets that we can work on with the person behind us...so its possible Girl 1 mostly wanted my seat so she could work with Girl 2 on it.  Also, I was in the front seat in the far left corner. There are about 10 seats closer to the middle board than the seat I was in.AITA for having little sympathy that my parents are kicking my boyfriend out? I’ve been living at my parent’s house with my boyfriend close to three years now. I applied back in December for a position as a flight attendant and I’ve received confirmation of my invitation for training. I will be leaving for the entirety of April and then returning home for a brief period then sent to a random domicile. My parents would like my boyfriend to move out before I leave for training due to this as I’ll no longer be living there.  

My boyfriend is upset, he’s saying he’ll need to work 60-70hrs a week just so he can move out. Which did not and doesn’t have to be the case. He was been without a job since the end of October which may not seem long period of time. However, I don’t even think he’s even held a job for 3 months since we’ve been together with long stints like this in between (if he had held a job for 3 months we wouldn’t even be here, just been waiting on having work history for both parties for a rental, I waaaant independence). I feel like I’ve and my family have been understanding about his work problems but I’m starting to feel very bogged down by it. 

He doesn’t consider getting 1000$/month for a part time job “worth it” in general hence why he hasn’t bothered to do that the entire time we’ve been together despite me telling him otherwise.  I hate those comments for a few reasons; it was my low paid ass at a cleaning job that sustained us, he could get insurance on his car meaning less constant mileage on mine,  he could pay for his medical bills, his phone, he’d been able to save for a place with me, and he’d have work history.  He currently receives around $500 a month from clinical trials, he buys food and flower/flower related items for us and sometimes items for his cat. Now,  because of the limited time period he gave himself he’s stressing out and not prepared at all to move out into an apartment .  In reality, he will most likely go back to his mom’s which is something he won’t even consider out-loud. Instead says he’s going to get a job, work insanely and hate himself and life, and get into a place next month...  that’s not how it works. He’s stressed about the situation and then gets himself worked up about the idea of working crazy hours when no one is asking him to. 

He’s had ample opportunity to get a job and I even set him up on his last one. His mom is horrible, but at this point I feel like my family and I have offered a good period of time for him to get his shit together and he squandered the time. Soo reddit AITA for not being sympathetic with him and just basically having the mindset of “you made your bed now lie in it” to a loved one?So, a little background information: we dated for 2 years and we broke up a month ago on ‘good terms’

I am a lot happier since we broke up and I am very relieved since then. Because I was tired of always being seen as the bad guy, having arguments about nothing and him acting like a complete child.

Last night, he asked if we could talk irl or in text to get something off of his chest. I said I’d rather want him to talk through text because I did not want to do it irl. Because I think that’s too awkward.

So, I got a very very long text in which he apologized for EVERYTHING he did to me and for the pain he caused me. And.. that he wanted me back.

I am a forgiving person, I will say sorry if YOU break my vase or something. As example. But I don’t want to forgive this YET. Because he caused me a lot of hurt and I don’t feel ready to forgive him. I still have a lot of anger and hurt inside of me and I think it wouldn’t be fair to myself if I already forgave him because I am not okay with it yet.

So I said no to his ‘Do you want me back to question.’ He then said, okay. But do you accept my apology. To which I said no.

He was so mad.

He called me a bitch and a devil and all other sorts kd insults that I don’t want to repeat.

“Why are you throwing away 2 years.”
“Why are you doing this to me.”
“You know I can’t live without you right?”
“This isn’t you.”
“You are my only reason I still wake up in the morning.”

I feel like a shit person.
I feel horrible and I’ve been sick all day because of this. Should I accept his apology and take him back? I feel horrible that I am hurting him this much.


Please reddit help me, AITA?


(not English so it isn’t that good I am very very sorry)INFO: My sister(24F) and I(22F) were separated at 5 and 3. Mom was on drugs, we were adopted into different families, our lives weren't great, hers was much worse. She was severely physically abused until she was 13 and moved in with my adoptive family. My adoptive mother was manipulative and emotionally abusive and we both have issues stemming from our childhood.

Story: About 4 months ago, my bf and I were living in a car in our (expensive) home town. My sister is on her way to owning a home about 3 hours away with her bf and their 2 daughters (1.5 & 3). Our mom (now sober!) and her offered for us to come stay with them for a while to get jobs, save up and eventually get our own spot in this cheaper area.

Our argument was last night, I stay out of the way she parents her children bc I want to stay in my lane and not be disrespectful of her. However, she is constantly yelling at them, and not just telling them to listen or do stuff. If they are crying, she threatens them with spankings if they won't stop. She says " do you want me to give you something to cry about" and if they are having a clingy day and want her she tells them " get the fuck away from me" "leave me the fuck alone" ETC. So her 18 month old spilled a bit of soda on the couch last night, from a can that was left open on the table by my sister. Sister realizes what happened and starts screaming at the top of her lungs " what the fuck is wrong with you? why the fuck would you do that" So I finally say something and I say " It's not that big a deal, it was an accident" she just gets pissed that I am even saying anything and is like "she's been yelled at and spanked before, she knows not to touch my stuff"

Me:" well, she's a baby it was an accident, I'm just saying you don't have to yell at her like that"

Her:" I don't see you cleaning this shit up, Don't start trying to tell me anything about my kids because that's a fight you're not gonna win"

Me: "I'm not trying to fight I am just saying it would be nice if you put yourself in their shoes bc I know it made me feel like shit when my adoptive mom talked to me like that"

Her: "I wish someone would put themselves in my shoes and deal with her ass all day"

Me: "You're literally her parent, it was your decision to do this"

Her: "I only wanted one kid and I didn't want to be the only one every doing anything (her bf is a shit dad who just works and that's it) I don't beat them or abuse them so stay out of it"

Me: "We both know that words aren't harmless and physical abuse isn't the only kind."

I feel like I owe her for letting us stay here (we pay $300) but I feel like my nieces well being is more important than my relationship with her. 

TLDR: My sister speaks to her kids in a way that I think is abusive, AITA for calling her out?A few days ago, I (58 years old female) was at the supermarket, where I saw a young girl (17-18) opening a can of hairspray and using it. She closed it and put it back on the shelf. After I saw her do that again with a different product, I turned to her and asked (not harshly, but assertively): "Do you realize that when you do that, you're using the content of products that people will buy? You're not stealing from the store you're stealing from them". She blushed and immediately answered "they're testers". Now, they aren't testers. There are no testers in this particular store. Those products will be sold or thrown away if no one wants to buy them. 

After saying my piece, I continued with my shopping. A few minutes later, the girl's mother suddenly accousted me, yelling "Are you *stalking* my daughter?! Who are you to tell her anything???" I looked at her, and saw that the daughter was a short distance behind. I asked "Is this what you want to teach your daughter? This type of behavior?" She continued yelling that I was a stalker and she'll call security so I said "I have no interest in continuing this conversation", and left. 

Now I have a bad feeling. Maybe it was none of my business. Thoughts?It’s about a month into the semester, and today was the first unit test in my math class. So I knew that my math teacher isn’t the best, but he did teach us a few things over the last month, not very much though. 

So I’m thinking that the test would reflect what he’s taught us so far, but when I look at it 90% of the info on the test has not been covered over the last month.

Because of this i went to our schools vice principle to file a complaint and to see about changing teachers. 

I’m wondering if I’m the asshole in this situation, because I know this teachers been complained about before, so what if it is me asking to switch classes that gets him fired? Am I the asshole?Hello everyone

So basically, I was on a date with my boyfriend last night, it was going really good (we have been together over a year now). He brought up a double date we are having on Saturday that I completely forgot about. He's friends with the boyfriend and I've never met them before, this will be my first time.

He said they are nice people but they smoke a lot of weed. Which is fine, I've smoked weed before, no big deal. The thing is I was depressed last year and I started smoking weed with 2 friends I don't associate with anymore. I kind of became dependent on it so I just pretty much stopped it completely.

A little about me, I have social anxiety and meeting people that I feel are important makes me nervous. Them, being his friends, makes me feel like i really need to impress them so I'm really nervous.

Im not sure how the conversation even came up, I forgot, but we were on the topic of weed and he said I should smoke to ease my nerves. I said that's a bad idea because I already know it will make me more nervous and paranoid. He said we should and that the art would look super cool (we are going to watch an art show/competition). I said no that I don't want to smoke it on the first time meeting someone. He then called me a square. I was kind of offended and I said that I'm not a square and that I just don't want to smoke weed.

He could tell that it upset me and then said it was just a joke. It still kind of bothered me because to make the joke he obviously thought even just a little bit that I'm a "square" for not wanting to do it so I was a little salty for about 10/15 minutes so the date kinda went a little less happy.

Am I the asshole for getting upset and somewhat ruining the date for getting upset at a joke I thought was kinda mean? Or is it justified? Also I never said I would never smoke with them, just not this first time.I've had my glasses for a year, and about 1-2 months ago I stepped on them, which resulted in the arms becoming flimsy, and one of them won't close. The glasses no longer have any spring, and they fall off my face whenever I use the phone or fix my hair. I finally made time to go to my eye doctor yesterday (I just walked in, no appointment) and asked if they could tighten the arms for me.

The optician who helped me told me that the spring in the arm that won't close was broken, and I would need new frames. I asked if she could tighten the other arm, and she said she would try. She heated the glasses up and curved them inward so that the arms would just naturally be closed together and fit better on my face. I tried them on, and they fit great, but they were all blurry.

We went back and forth with me trying them on, and her readjusting them, but it was like the lenses were melted or something. She said that it was because I had scratches on the lenses, and the protective film was "breaking down." It started to seem like there was no fixing them, so I kind of gave up on handing them back to her.

She kept asking me if I wanted to reschedule an appointment I missed, so I agreed, and we scheduled for several weeks from now. She told me to hang in there, and I could get new glasses soon. This was not an offer to replace my glasses or pick up the cost.

I left and thankfully had a spare pair of glasses from an old prescription in my car. I've been thinking about it all night and morning, and I'm torn about what to do. I feel like it's kind of a dick move to complain when she was only trying to help, but I also feel like I'm a pushover if I just let it go. I need someone uninvolved to give me their 2 cents.

WIBTA if I reached out to the manager and asked if they could replace my lenses?  I (26f) recently got a new flatmate (25m), renting one of the rooms in an apartment in my name. The two other people living here are away for weeks at the time, so it's mostly me and him (especially in the past 5 weeks). He's friendly and social and everything has been great for the first 3 months, we hung out and I felt comfortable hanging around the flat looking like sh\*t, which is very important to me, as I am one of those people who recharge batteries away from social situations.

He recently got a girlfriend, who seems nice and rents a room in an flat nearby. Even though we had all agreed to try and give one other fair warning when bringing someone home, he lets me know she's coming over approximately 30 seconds before she arrives. As I feel uncomfortable being the extra-person in the room during date nights and snuggle time, I tend to either go out or lock myself in my room when he brings her home (she always comes over mid-week and after 9pm and I don’t love going out in the snow just to give them space). Kitchen and living room are the same room, so I only use the bathroom and smoke out of my bedroom window.

Last week I was on my way home from work, looking forward to taking off my bra and relaxing on the couch in front of the TV. As I walked in he told me she was on her way over and they were going to cook and have a romantic dinner. She had already been over 3 three times during the same week, talking loudly right outside my door late at night knowing I had an early shift. So I snapped and told him "It's okay for tonight, but this cannot be an everyday thing, next time please go to her place". I apologized for the tone a couple minutes later, but I stood by my statement. He wants me to be comfortable having her around the apartment, and it's nice of him, but he also said he'd like her to stay over every night and his bed is more comfortable than hers so he'd rather have her sleep here.

I don't want to be the a\*\*hole who tells him she cannot come over, and I am aware that there is no real issue with me looking like shit or sitting in the common areas while she's there, but I simply don't feel comfortable. I didn't rent the room to a couple because I've lived with couples before and it was a nightmare (it's not nice having to third wheel every time you want to watch a movie on the couch in your own home). Obviously, he should be able to have his girlfriend over, but it's starting to be too often and he's taking over the entire apartment, since at this point, I'm either out or in my room. This is the first time he lives in a shared flat, he's always had his own place and that results in him not really thinking about anyone else other than himself when it comes to shared spaces. Talking to him hasn’t given any results.

I need to know: AITA for not wanting her to come over every day or is it reasonable to say no to something that makes me feel uncomfortable in my own home?I was at a family gathering. People were talking about Frozen 2, including my teenage male cousin and how it was just released on video. I was asked if I've seenit.

I said basically "Well I'm not a 7-year old girl, nor do I have any kids, so no I have not seen Frozen 2 or the original."

My aunt laughed but kind of a mocking laugh and her teenage son kind of rolled his eyes. Everybody seemed to think I was kind of a dick over that. No one there was a small girl or the target audience for Frozen so I was pretty surprised.

So AITA?Today I went into a hardware store to return an angle grinder under warranty. A few staff gathered around me at the counter since I was the only customer at the time. 

One of the older guys who came over looked at the grinder and said "what's that?"

I jokingly answered "a cake"
He took offence and told me theres no need for that. 

I didnt say anything after that since he's entitled to feel however he wants.
Now I figure that a hardware store is a pretty normal place to give each other a bit of shit and rip the piss on each other like most tradesmen tend to do? 


Was I being an asshole and have a shitty sense of humor? Or is this guy not able to handle a joke at his expense?I run a social meet-up group where we're a bunch of 20 somethings who meet-up after work to grab a few drinks and try out different bars. I've made it very clear on all our events that people need to obey the law and not harass other people, otherwise we're a pretty tolerant group. 

Last Friday we were trying out a new bar and there were a bunch of new people, one guy I didn't recognise but a few of the other regulars recognised him. After about an hour or so of drinking he suddenly pours a substance and starts snorting it off the table. He turns to me and offers me a "bump" and I decline and tell him he shouldn't be doing drugs. He goes on a rant about "legalise it" and how its his body and whatnot. I'm not in the mood to argue so ask him to leave, he doesn't want to so I go to the bar to get a drink and avoid him. 

About an hour or so later he's stumbling all over the place and being a nuisance, the bouncers approach him and manhandle him out of the bar. I follow to see if everything's ok and they tell me some other patrons reported him for doing drugs. They want to throw out entire party out but I explain i don't know who he is and he's new to our group. I mention we're a large group and are spending money so they relent.

They dump him in the alley next to the bar and leave him there. I spend about 30 minutes with him trying to get him to tell me where he lives, to open his phone or let me call someone for him. He's completely incoherent and doesn't want to open his phone. I give up and leave him there and head back inside.

About 4 hours later we're leaving and I check the alley, he's up and about and stumbling all over the place but is still incoherent. I ignore it and head home. 

I get a text form him tonight asking where the event is tomorrow, I message back and say "I don't want you at my events, we don't allows drugs" and block him. A few of his friends in the group then message me and please his case and say that he's not usually like this and he just had a bad reaction.
This comes from a long, long chain of problems throughout the years. The brigade have made surprise visits for four consecutive years on my birthday, unwanted. When I was doing homework during my birthday two years ago, I was surprised with a confetti cannon in my room! There’s still confetti I find. My aunt and cousin have been brainwashing my grandma whilst grieving over her own mother’s death that “men are bad” and “entitlement is key.” 

This Christmas was too much. My mom has some health issues so a very peculiar diet, and all they had for her were organic berries. BERRIES? I made my mom her food and we brought it to my grandparent’s house to finish baking, and I smugly told them all “since you guys didn’t make her anything, I did.” My mother was grateful. 

My thirteen year old barely pubescent cousin takes my grandfather’s seat at the head of the table, and when he asks her to move, she says “No! I got here first.” And he just sat down defeatedly. Then she started eating before everyone was seated. I believe it’s kinda tradition to wait, and not take grandpa’s seat. Anyway, my cousin stuffed her face and practically pulled us all into the next room to open gifts. I know she’s a kid (13), I’m 17, but holy hell I’ve never seen such greed! She ripped through at least 20 presents (I’m not kidding) without thanking anyone and then saying “is that it?” They somehow pulled three more from their asses and asked the same. My mother and I were in shock.

My mom and I leave shortly after because we can’t comprehend this entitlement, and now my grandma is saying “men are bad.” A few days later my grandma calls and said we were ungrateful at Christmas and she. Went. Off. My mom ripped her a new one, basically laying down what happened. They talked it over lunch a few days later and all is sorta well. 

My grandma comes a month and a half later while I’m concussed and brings along thank you cards. She said that I didn’t properly thank my grandpa and now we will be writing thank you cards. Not everyone else. Just me. my mom went off again. By the way, I said thank you to my grandpa and gave him a hug at Christmas. That’s enough of thanks right? When she left, I opened the cards. She left stamps. I wrote her a sarcastic thank you card for the thank you cards. A bonus tidbit, my aunt and cousin have a one legged sugar daddy that funds their entire lifestyle of trips and not going to school except for like two days a week, and is sleeping in his office while PAYING THEIR RENT WHICH IS HALF OFF CAUSE ITS MY GRANDPARENTS PLACE. it’s a small beach condo if you’re curious. 
I’m so over their drama at this point, and I don’t want their entitlement ruining graduation day or anything else, so AITA for not wanting these nut jobs around? 

(If you need more stories of them I have many more just ask)Ok so I was on a bus and a drunk guy standing at the front pissed himself. All over the floor. He did it one stop before he got off - at a pub that I saw him go into. Everyone who got on or off the bus after that had to walk through his piss. I posted on facebook 'Guy just pissed himself on the bus'. As you do. 

One woman who I know  irl (she was a friend of a friend who I'm not friends with anymore but I've hired her for craftwork before and had plans to hire her again -so not someone I see on a daily basis or anything) posted telling me off for 'judging' the guy, said that I was 'better than that', that people can have all kind of conditions that make them soil themselves in public and they feel ashamed enough and I should know better cos I'm a care worker. I asked her to unfriend me.

 This same woman has previously posted on other statuses of mine telling me off for drinking so much coffee, telling me SHE had always gotten through night shifts without coffee, I should drink more water, telling me if I keep drinking coffee I'm going to have a heart attack before 40. She's posted similar warnings about the sugar content of food I've posted, told me off for posting articles from outlets she disapproves of... You get the idea - she scolds me on my facebook posts like I'm a silly child and I've always kind of rolled my eyes and thought 'she means well'. But I REALLY feel like her bringing my job into it this time and acting like I was in any way harming disabled people by not being delighted with a drunk guy pissing on the floor a couple feet from me was over the line. 

Compared with MY comments on HER posts - I have NEVER commented anything negative. I have liked all her cat posts, commented on how cute the cat was, posted my sympathies when another of her pets died, complimented and boosted her posts about her craft projects....I've been NOTHING but nice and positive to this woman!

My reply this time was 'with all the love in the world maybe you would be better off just unfriending me rather than commenting negatively on everything I post. I'm not angry at you, I understand you mean well, but I'm at the point where I'm limiting my facebook use and second guessing what I post on my own page because I know you're going to comment on it.' All of which was true - I have frequently decided it's just not worth her drama to post something I would normally post. 

She replied telling me 'if you want to focus on the negativity you will' and then unfriended me and THEN blocked me. Which I think was weirdly petty.

Do you think I was too harsh? Am I in the wrong here? AITA?I guess surely NTA, but maybe ESH?

Two weeks ago the electricity in my house broke. I still have electricity in my living room and the kitchen, but that's it. When I try to use electricity in either the bathroom, hallway or bedroom everything shuts off immediately. 

So, I called my landlord and explained the problem. He gave me the phone number of his technician and told me to schedule an appointment with him to check it out and he would inform the technician I was going to invite him in his name.

So I send the guy a message stating that I was renting the house from landlord and was having the issue with the electricity and when he'd have time to check it out. I got a response from him 3 days later that he could come by that day. Unfortunately by that time I had made plans and was out of town. I texted him 2 days after that apologising for not responding immediately but that those days didn't fit & when would be another opportunity. 

No response. So I gave the guy a call on Tuesday asking when he would have time to come by. He told me he would be able to drop by today somewhere in the afternoon so I said ok! Great! I'll make sure I'll work from home so I can let you in and show the issue. 

So today came and I waited. I was in the living room working so I'd have a clear view of the window facing the street and only moved to use the toilet. At 16:00 I still didn't see anyone so I decided to give the guy a call to see if he was held up somewhere or if something was going on. As soon as he picked up the phone he started screaming at me that I was a crazy person, a bitch and I wasted his time. I asked him what was wrong, as I waited for him all day and apparently he went by 3 times and none of the times I opened the door as I wasn't home.

I told him I was home all day and he started screaming at me that I wasn't. I tried to explain again and he told me he rung the doorbell and immediately jumped in his car again and sped off. Well.. You see, my doorbell isn't working due to the electrical issue.. I didn't think about that at all until he told me he rang my doorbell. So I tried to explain him that I was very sorry but my doorbell wasn't working due to the electrical issue, and I tried asking him why he didn't knock on the door or called me but he swore at me some more and then just hung up.

I'm completely shocked by this event. I honestly didn't think about the doorbell working or not, he had my phone number and could have given me a call any time.. 

AITA? Or in better words.. Do I suck here too?My (34M) daughter (14F) had a sleepover b-day party last saturday, and she invited 5 girls from her school.

There was this one girl that she invited who I could tell from her attitude, was a spoiled brat. When she rang the doorbell, she walked in looking down at her phone, didn't greet me or my wife, and handed me her jacket without even looking up.

The whole night she was on her phone doing whatever the heck 14 year olds do on phones. I thought she was just embarrassed or shy because maybe she didn't know anyone, but according to my daughter, she is a "super duper cool girl".

Anyways, towards the end of the night, my daughter was opening her gifts. SB made a comment about every single gift. (not exactly snarky, but more like she was just unimpressed)

The final gift was from me and my wife, we bought her an iPhone 7 by pooling all of our remaining extra money to buy her it.

the SB scoffed because she had the newest gen iPhone. I helped my daughter set up the phone with a sim card, and the rest of the night they just hung out in her room.

My daughter came down a bit later and she was just sitting on the couch, I asked her what was wrong and she just went back up while saying "why couldn't you have just bought me the newest iphone??". That was really out of character for her, as she is always grateful for receiving anything.

My daughter left the phone on the table. I grabbed my daughter's phone to see a bunch of texts going back and forth between SB and my daughter, they exchanged numbers and the convo went something like this:

D "hey its me"

SB "thanks for inviting me to ur lame slumber party lol, and congrats on the iphone SEVEN haha"

D "what"

SB: "arent u mad that ur parents and friends got u such lame gifts"

SB "slumber parties are for little girls lol, but wtvs its cool"

D "u dont like the party..?"

SB "I jus wish i could go home looool"

\~end

It was around 1AM and the girls were still up talking, I knocked and asked if I could speak with SB, she looked confused, I told her she needs to grab her things something came up. (I did this as to not embarrass my daughter in front of her friends).

I took her downstairs and asked her to call her mom, she asked why and I said "because thats what you said right? that you wish you could go home? so go." She was tearing up a bit, and made the call.

I talked w/ her mom for a bit when she came, I showed her the texts and she apologized profusely and said "its just a teenager phase I guess. I'm so sorry, but dont you think she could stay? If not I understand."

I thought ab it for a bit, but her staying probably would have made it awkward for everyone, so I told her it was best if they just left.

My wife said that I overreacted, and I should have just talked with SB rather than immediately kick her out, I firmly believe I taught her a good lesson that she needed to learn. It was MY DAUGHTER's bday, and I didn't want the rest of her night ruined because of some spoiled brat who was making it all about her. I guess she didn't exactly do anything wrong, but at the same time her attitude was unbelievable. AITA?So I have two younger sisters. One lives in the Big Apple and her packages kept getting stolen. She had asked to use my account before (she didn't know about amazon locker, she just wanted it for the quick shipping and tv shows) and I told her no since she didn't need to see the stuff I buy.

Her packages kept getting stolen so I found an amazon locker near her and let her use my account after all. This sister is in her early 20s and is usually respectful if other people's things, so i was OK letting her use my account with my card and my friend who I let use my accounts card info.

My youngest sister, 19yo, texted me yesterday asking if she could use my prime account. I do not feel comfortable with her having access to me, my friend and my other sisters credit/debit cards especially since she and the other sister don't get along, and I can easily foresee the youngest sister buying a bunch of stuff off middle sisters card if she got mad at her.

Youngest sister has a sweet heart usually but has very poor boundaries (thanks borderline mother). I could name off a whole list of stupid decisions she has made over the last few years due to lack of boundaries and self control. She has lost many friends and is now on academic probation her 2nd semester of ministry school (lol) because she plagiarized a paper and then paid a girl to write a final paper and the school found out about it (this is after me offering to help her with her papers too). 

After I received the text from youngest asking if she could use my prime account I asked middle if she had mentioned to youngest that she uses my account. She said no. I then texted youngest back saying:

 'Sorry ___, I don't feel comfortable sharing the account with all the credit card info on there. You could use Prime student, where you get 6 mos free then pay only $6.49/mo after. If you want for your birthday I can pay for 5 months of student prime so you get almost a whole year free." I also told her how to go about obtaining prime student.

She never responded which usually means she is mad.

When i was her age I would have jumped at the opportunity for someone else to pay for prime even if it was one of my bday gifts. If I didn't know about prime student I would have been happy to have found out about it. 

She works and lives at home and doesn't pay for school (thanks to oldest sister filling out her fafsa for her) so she can afford it way more easily than I could at her age. 

So, AITA for not letting her on my prime account even though middle sis is on it (unbeknownst to youngest)?

Edit: I texted her earlier telling her she can send me the link to anything she wants on Amazon and I can ship it to her. Haven't heard back.So my friend is getting married in May. I have known about the wedding since December 2018, when she asked me to be a bridesmaid. Of course I said yes. 

Now flash forward to when invitations are finally coming out, I learn that I’m the only bridesmaid without a plus one. Granted, the rest of them are seeing someone, but I’m very annoyed by this. First off, I’m spending at a very minimum $800 for the wedding and bachelorette weekend and I can’t even bring a date? Secondly, I don’t even like most of the bridal party because they’re annoying and fake so I was really looking forward to bringing someone to keep me calm while dealing with unnecessary drama. And finally, I recall her asking like 8 months ago if I would want a guest and I said yes so I have someone to like dance with and all other typically wedding date things, so she must’ve completely ignored that request. 

I haven’t said anything yet, but I’m thinking about mentioning something? I’m not 100% sure who I would take but I was thinking of bring one of my best guy friends who could make a miserable night fun. And maybe I’m terrible for saying I’ll be miserable, but I have to spend my entire weekend with a bunch of girls I never really liked. 

Oh, and the grooms a dick but I just kindly smile and don’t say anything so neither of them know I don’t like him.AITA for not dropping everything to see my parents with them giving me no notice?

My parent a live in a city about 3 hours away from me. My dad is in semi-frequently for business, and often wants to meet up for lunch. Backstory about my parents: we don’t exactly get along because they tried to control me my entire childhood. This includes but is not limited to: demanding to see my personal credit card statement which I pay for; forcing me to accept that they pay my rent while I have a full time job and can afford rent (to hold over my head); and forcing gifts on me that I do not want, need, or asked for (also to hold over my head). They also have a habit of being entitled when it comes to me and my time. This includes but is not limited to: demanding that I tell my work that I will not be working FOR A WEEK so I can go on a trip that they sprung on me and didn’t know about; promising that they will provide me rent while going to school (quit my job for it) and will not back out of it (in writing) and then telling me THE NEXT DAY that they won’t actually do it because I won’t show them the floor of my room; and calling me out of the blue and being suuuuuper angry when I don’t answer for good reasons (studying, with friends, walking outside when it freezing, at work). They’re unreasonable, they have been all my life so now I brace for it.

So, yesterday my dad calls me and tells me that he’s going to be in the city and wants to meet for lunch. Now, he’s had a history of freaking out about me having plans and refusing to drop them last minute for lunch with him, even though it greatly inconveniences me and I have to rearrange my entire life for that one thing, not to mention cancel plans, which can range from school to meetings to just plans with friends. Therefore, when he calls, I brace myself for him to freak out, when I tell him that I have a very busy day. Mind you, these dinners are usually just him telling me what a failure I am and how much him and my mom hate me (and he wonders why I don’t want to go).

This time I told him I’m sorry, that I have a super busy Thursday, and I won’t be able to meet him, but if I had just had a few days notice I probably could have made it work. Well, he freaked out because apparently I should have just said no, sorry, and everything would have been fine, despite literally every other time I did that he freaked out telling me I should drop my other plans for him.

He says he doesn’t get notice for when he’s going to be here - I know that isn’t true, they go on the calendar a couple weeks in advance. I would understand if it was only once in a while, but it’s every time. Not to mention that every time I have something that involves him, I give him MONTHS of notice, but he will ask me even up until that day if that thing is happening. His memory is fine otherwise.

So, Reddit, AITA for trying to protect myself from his emotional outbursts by reminding him that I’d be available given a few days notice?My roomates (23M and 26M) and I (23F) have been sent to a diferent country for 6 months for work. We live together due to budgeting and I kind of took the mum role and enabled them.
I used to cook, to text them to see if they were all right, to schedule lunch, plan dinner, etc, urge them to wash the dishes and help out around. Whenever I went to the supermarket or market I asked them if they wanted me to get something for them. They never did the same.
I went to a trip to see my mum and my flight was cancelled and they didn't text once to find out if I was okay. I missed a day in work and they didn't ask me. I went home to discover it was a mess, dishes were dirty, clothes everywhere, the fridge was empty (I filled the fridge before leaving, including 1.5 dozens of eggs, all gone) and I was hungry, they went to get food and didn't bother to ask me if I wanted some. I was so tired I went to bed to sleep without dinner and woke up early to go to the gym and get breakfast at the office.
The day of my flight my manager called me twice, first at lunch and then at the airport basically urging me to try my best and give it a 110% to make peacefull living with my roomates. I didn't know why he did that and I don't know if it is related). I brought them gifts from my trip and they didn't bother to invite me for lunch today.
I feel betrayed and even though I might be too nagging and too order-obsessed, I feel I shouldn't be treated like this. I mean, I could be sent back or even lose my job if I mess up, I cannot believe they didn't talk to me first or said anything.Little background on this. My boyfriend (27M) and I (23F) have been together for 5 years. Early financial mistakes we made have caused us to still be in about 10K worth of credit card debt. I have maintained a steady job the entire time, while he has held various jobs here and there. I have always been the bread winner and the person in charge of financials with all of our excess money going towards debt. 

Right now both us are in a good spot in life. We both like our jobs and have had them for a little bit of time now. He is constantly trying to think and find different “side hustles” to make money. I love his creativity and mindset for this, but I lack on communicating any ideas with him. I think everyday about different ways to make money, but our main issue is anything ideas he comes up with cost money and he rather try and fail, than look at the actual facts or figures on how his ideas would actually play out. He hates that most of the time when he comes with me with an idea I say I don’t know. For me I have to actually research these ideas and then formulate an opinion on them. He ignores that fact and chastises me and accuses me of not wanting to make any money or even hustle. So I get all of the blame and more of the financial burden on my shoulders. AITH?So basically what happened was one of my best friends sent a Snapchat to our friend group showing he was going to a concert. Later that night he sent in the chat “A SPEAKER FELL ON MY LEG!!!” I responded that he should probably go to the hospital. He said “fuck no I’m not paying for that.” 
In my mind, that automatically put it from a serious situation to a not-so-serious one. If you get in a car accident and your leg gets blown off, you aren’t gonna say “no don’t take me to the hospital I’m not paying for that.” So I thought ok, a speaker fell, but it isn’t as serious as I originally made it out to be (I DID tell him to go to the hospital.) 

Fast forward to the next day and I’m at work bright and early. I hadn’t slept much the night before, and it was very dead at my work place. I remembered that I left a marijuana cart and pen with him, so I texted him asking if he could bring it over since it was so dead at work and there was nothing to do. He responded with “IM IN THE FUCKING HOSPITAL!!!!” I immediately said I was sorry and tried to explain I was tired and in early morning work mode and that I didn’t realize it was as serious as it was, and that I knew he was at the concert with other friends (he wasn’t alone.) 

I’ve tried to apologize/explain myself numerous times but he always responds with stuff like “I don’t want to be friends with someone that treats me like an after thought. You should have at least made sure I got the hospital.” 

AITA?

Edit: Whenever I try to explain to him that he’s misunderstanding a situation he’s angry about he always says I’m “gaslighting.”

Edit #2: He is actually an amazing person and great friend, I do miss him, I’m not going to cut him off as some of you have suggested, I hope to re kindle the friendship someday.
Throwaway, and on mobile.

Walked into the kitchen where my Mom was and her boyfriend (whom I don’t like) and she told me she was leaving to go drop off a bill at the city hall. She never drops them off in person, so I asked her what kind of bill it was. She told me it was a bill-bill. Like taxes. I asked again, trying to just figure what kind of bill it was. My mom can be shifty and can go behind our backs for her own reasons “because thats something parents can do”. I then said “Oh so it must be like something secretive” She usually shows me the bills and likes me to see how much we pay each month, so asking to see the bills isnt a big deal. She got fed up with me asking and told me to stop, so I tried to tell her I was just being curious because she never drops them off in person. Her boyfriend then spoke up and said that I need to “quit being an asshole” and stop asking. If she doesnt want to tell me, she doesnt have to. I left the room and a few minutes later came back to get a pop tart (originally the reason I entered the kitchen). My mom had gone upstairs and her boyfriend was still there and said “If I ever talked to my mom that way, my dad would have beat me”.
AITI?

edit: She did show me the envelope and tell me it wasnt anything secretive, it was just a bill. I asked why she was dropping it off at city hall, and thats when her boyfriend spoke up. Sorry for forgetting this detail.I am 41(m) and she is 28(f) and we have a 4 yr old boy . We have live together for about 5 years now and we usually do pretty good at sharing everything. She works a full-time job. I only work two days a week as a bartender. So when she works I watch our boy. The two nights I work of course she's here sleeping with our son. I'm not the tidiest person by any means. But I do pick up every single day she always leaves your clothes on the floor and never pick some up tells me not to touch them and she'll pick them up later. Well later becomes never. And I end up doing it anyways. And I'm starting to get resentful towards her because I get no help. And she said she's always tired from work. She's a hairdresser by the way. now I've always cooked ever since the day we met she does not cook. She cleans but usually only when family is coming. Which is NOT often at all! Now we argue quite often about this so my main question is AITA for complaining about her not helping at all and it's starting to look like a pigsty around here???I feel like I'm the asshole in this situation but I want some more opinions.

So like 3 months ago my friend [19F] was clearing out her closet and said I [18F] could take whatever I wanted and keep it, and I happened to take this pair of brown boots. I never wear them but my sister does sometimes so I kept them around.

My friend has just asked for them back, but I kind of don't want to give them back out of principle. Surely if  someone gives you something and they say you can keep it you don't have to give them back? She has taken loads of my makeup and makeup brushes without asking and I haven't commented on it because its stuff I don't really use.

I replied to her and said I'm not sure if I still have them, and I might give them to my sister and get them to take them to her house so if my friend
comes round she won't see them..

edit: so i thought i had them (as i said in the title) and assumed they would be in my closet but i just looked in my room and i dont have them anyway lol oopsOur city is having a a little bit of snow and cold. Just enough to close a school or two. In a city off over a million it’s not really a big deal. A woman was scheduled for a job interview at 11am. At 9:30 am she calls to say she isn’t going to make it because of the weather and she rides the bus. Implying the buses will be running late. I explain to her there is no rush, I will be here until 2pm today. She isn’t happy and asks to come in another day. I tell her no, it’s today or she can move on in her search for employment. She says ‘okay, thank you’, and hangs up. 

Here’s my thinking. All of my employees came to work without issue. All of them ride the bus and arrived early. It was merely a cold snap. Nothing more. If this woman wouldn’t make it to an interview to get a job, what is her attendance going to be like if she’s hired? A job is not that important to her. Not important enough to get therefore not important enough to keep. Thoughts?Me (18) and my brother (12) have a rocky relationship. I guess it's because we are roughly six to seven years apart and he is the youngest of the sibling group. He constantly manipulates mom into believing he's always right and he gets his way out of it. Anyway, I do about 80% of the household chores. Every now and then I'd ask him if he can do something miniscule like taking out the trash or sweeping the floor and talks of the likeness while I do the rest. Of course, he has a temper tantrum and ~~loudly~~ tells me that *I*  should do it because it's a woman's job to do those tasks and clean the house. 

A few months ago, my sister visited and explained to my mom that I was doing too many chores and that Brother should be doing stuff too because me and Sister started kitchen based chores at about the age of eleven to twelve (washing dishes, dishwasher, ect.). Mom agreed and made chore-chart-like-things. Well, Brother did *not* like this and told me to do them or else "he'd tell mom" and things of the likeness. I told him that they were on his list and that he should do them. I did them anyway (probably shouldn't have). Well, that didn't go well as you can imagine. He keeps telling mom amd dad that I was being a good sister by saying that I *wanted* to do the chores on his list and that I allowed him to go watch tv and stuff like that. I told mom that it wasn't true. 

Would I be the asshole of I stopped doing his chores? I don't want him to get in trouble. I just want him to learn how to be a human  when I graduate and when he gets a home of his own. (Mom doesn't beleve that I want that)Recently my aunt passed away. The funeral will be held two hours from where I live with my mom. We’re planning to go to the funereal but because of the distance we’ll be staying there from Friday night to Sunday morning. I wasn’t very close to my aunt but she was my moms last living sibling (my uncle and and grandparents having passed years before). She’s taking it rather hard. She’s asked me to come for support (although I expected to go anyway since it will be the first time in years that side of my family has gotten together ). My uncle has insisted that we stay with him, and it’s been implied that most of the family will be staying there too. My problem is that our sleeping arrangements aren’t exactly secure. My 57 year old arthritic mother and I (currently almost 8 months pregnant ) could end up sleeping on a couch or the floor or sharing a bed. I would much rather get a hotel room, but when my mom tentatively suggested it she said my uncle got insulted, and again insisted we would have room and be comfortable. I would rather just get the room anyway but my mother gets upset whenever I bring it up. Apparently my getting a room would be unsupportive and if I can’t make it work at my uncles house then I should just stay home. I’m 26 years old. Filling capable of getting there getting a room and going to the funeral without my mom. But I would very much like to support her. Tell me AITA for wanting a room?A bit of context:

I'm (33) about to finish school and have begun looking for my next position. My ex-wife (32) has primary custody of our kids, a girl (8) and a boy (5). I have a strong relationship with the kids and my ex-wife. We've been divorced for 5 years, and she remarried soon after that. Her new husband is a wonderful step-dad to the kids, and I really couldn't have asked for a better situation. I currently see the kids about 30% of every month (alternating weekends and weekly dinners). I already have a steady job in the city where we all currently live and would be content keeping it after I graduate.

All of that being said, this is the city I was born and raised in. I would welcome a change of scenery and have been considering looking for a position in NYC. I would be in a different kind of position (my dream job) from the role I currently fill but would be making the same amount of money. I get long periods of time off every year and would be flying back to see the kids regularly for their entire school breaks, and at least one weekend every two months. I would also like to be able to bring them to NYC regularly. I have floated the idea of me living in another state to my ex and she was supportive about it, saying she would help me work to maintain a strong presence in the kid's lives. I have every reason to believe that she was being sincere, and I would want to face time the kids daily, and maintain a strong relationship with them, even if it is from a distance.

So with all of that said, WIBTA?

TLDR: WIBTA if I moved to another state to take my dream job, leave my kids with their other parent, and see them less every year?Edit- I know this is wrong but I checked his tablet this morning when he went to work to see if I can find any information. His amazon was still logged in and found my ring on there, actually 2 of them. 
The first one was bought December 2nd and then another one a size smaller last night. 

https://www.amazon.com/Jude-Jewelers-Classical-Stainless-Engagement/dp/B07917KBV9/ref=mp_s_a_1_46_sspa?keywords=.25+cz+solitaire&amp;amp;amp;qid=1582739679&amp;amp;amp;sr=8-46-spons&amp;amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;amp;smid=A25CCG2ULY9X5G&amp;amp;amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUE0NFlYT0tEOTdaNEwmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA2NTkzMzgzRTQ2TEVDNzAzTkNJJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA0ODg4OTUyQVlQVlhQTEMyM0NUJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfcGhvbmVfc2VhcmNoX2J0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=

I’m beyond words. Not that it’s not a Tiffany ring but that he was playing me with a $6 ring. After he purchased a mini bar and an OLED TV for himself on Black Friday. I can’t believe I went into Tiffany’s with a $5 rip off. I’m mortified. 

Edit again- so I texted him the link while he’s at work. He called me like 2 seconds later and asked me what’s going on. I said I went on his iPad because I had to use it and he left the browser on this. (Little lie on my part) I told him I don’t care about the ring but devastated at the lies. I told him if he doesn’t tell me the truth right now and why he did it that I’m getting a hotel and he won’t see me when he gets home.
He started crying saying that he felt like he needed to get me the best but he couldn’t afford it. I said but you could afford the 3k on your stuff. He said the smallest Tiffany ring is at least 5k which i doubt is true I’m sure there’s cheaper but whatever and that he just wanted to get me a stand in until he saved up. I told him I didn’t even need the Tiffany ring. That he could have bought a $200 14k gold band at Macy’s. Instead he spent money on a box and two fake rings. He then confessed and said that he got the box from his friend that proposed with a Tiffany ring years ago and the wife doesn’t need the boxes. 
I hung up. I texted him I need some space and time and I’m going to go stay at a hotel to just chill for a day.







My fiancé proposed on Christmas and everything was perfect. The ring was a bit too big though and I’ve just hit my goal weight (I was losing weight) so I figured I’d have it sized correctly. I’ve been holding off because I wanted to make sure I was the correct size after losing the weight. 

The ring box says Tiffany and Co. and I was literally over the moon with it. I told him he shouldn’t have spent this much on me but he said he wanted to get me the blue box. I go into Tiffany’s to have it sized because my friend told me I should only have them work on my ring. They take the ring and ask my for my fiancé’s info to look up in their system. They can’t find it and she takes the ring in the back. The manager comes back a little while after and says that this isn’t a Tiffany and co ring and shows me there’s no engraving inside. 

I go home and my first thought is that he probably bought it preloved and he got duped. 
He comes home from work and I ask him where he got the ring from. He said Tiffany and Co. at (locations name) I flat out asked him if he got it used online and it was okay if he did. He flipped out and said no it’s new from the store. I fessed up and told him what happened with the sizing. He flipped out and said that I was checking up on him and snooping for the price, etc. I was firm and said no I just wanted it resized and they told me it’s not from their company. He said that they’re wrong and he got it there. 

He told me that I should have consulted him and he would of had it sized for me and that it feels like I’m going behind his back. I’m confused by this because I thought it was a simple task that I didn’t need him for. Anyway, he won’t really talk about where he got the ring and is only saying that he will size it and took the ring.My 20-yo brother just started uni this winter and has been living with me since January (due to weird student lounge system) This is problematic, bc I'm an introvert who needs my own space to function properly and I don't click with his personality (He's misogynistic, vain, lazy, antisocial and is never grateful whenever I help him with school or life)

Anyway, my space is getting invaded, I have no idea how long he's gonna live with me, I have my own degree to deal with, an internship to prepare for, and I'm getting CBT for major depression and anxiety. It's a stressful situation, and stress makes me irritated on a daily basis.

Timeskip to January, it's ok the few first days until I realize he's the worst roommate, a freeloader. He doesn't clean up after himself, doesn't wash the dishes and doesn't cook at all; which means I have to do all of that for him. (He eats my cooking though? Fair? Eh) And whenever I tell him to do something he just goes "OK" but doesn't do anything about it. He's clogged up my sink and shower thrice and his only response is "oops." At this point, I'm basically his servant.

I, the big baby, call my parents and tell them about the situation but since I'm the oldest kid and asian I have to take care and look out for him. They're no help, as always, and tell me to be patient and be there for him until he finds his own place.

February rolls in  and I have to study, but I can't. He keeps blasting his series behind me, keep snacking on my snack stash and ruin my concentration simply by being in the same room as me. I tell him to be quiet, but end up irritated and go for a walk to nurse my anger away, but it's affecting me mentally and I'm always annoyed. Which is bad because when the passive aggression drops I get downright mean.

Anyway, last week I called my parents again and threatened I would kick him out if he couldn't do the bare minimum a roommate would do and he went ballistic on me during my tirade and says "I DO CLEAN UP AFTER MYSELF YOU BITCH!" well fam, you do? (Narrator voice: He didn't do shit)

And now, he's been giving me the silent treatment until a few hours ago wherein he asked help with printing some stuff. I glance and see they're leases. So, he's potentially gotten a new place and will probably leave next week. In short, because of all my issues with him and my constant nagging on him just to do his shit, he's fed up and ready to move out.

I know I have flaws and can get really angry when people cross me and downright mean when it happens. This situation wasn't pleasant for him either but is it really too much to ask him to help out at home if he wanna live with me and stop using me as a servant? AITA here?

&#x200B;

TL;DR

20-yo Brother is the worst roommate who doesn't do household chores or respect my boundaries and I nag at him to do these basic stuff. This causes him to move out. AITA?I live with my partner of 2 years. It was established early on in our relationship that neither of us use marijuana (though we had both tried it separately several years ago and did not like it.)

I came home from work to discover the house smelled like marijuana. Confronted them, and they made it clear they did it in secret from me, they didn't think I would smell it, and claimed they had started taking it recently for their migraines.

I am not against marijuana use in general, however I do not use it and do not want to be in a relationship with someone who does. If they had explained beforehand that it was for their migraines, I would not have been happy but I would have tried to understand.

AITA for being upset about this? AITA if I were to leave them, because they decided to do something that was a deal breaker since day one, and try to hide it?So I had a drawer set I put up for sale on my local website (kijiji) for $90. People were interested and wanted to buy it but my sister found me on the website and asked me to give it to her. I told her I initially paid $75 for it and never used it so she can pay me that. 

She negotiated $60 and I was like okay whatever I dont want to argue over $15. 

Then a few hours later, she asked to give it to her for free because she was my sister. I said no. We had an argument over it. She claimed sisters shouldn't have to pay and that I wasn't using the drawer. She doesnt ask for much. And so on. 

I told her, I wanted the same drawer and I paid for it. What makes you deserve it for free and not me. I also told her if you needed something, as a sister I would give it for free. (I've given her pregnancy items and baby stuff for her kids). But this is something she wants and therefore it doesnt have to be free, especially since I paid out of pocket for it. 

She is failing to realize that 1. I paid out of pocket. 2. It wasn't sitting in my storage, I had actively tried to sell it to make some money to pay a bill. 3. She doesnt need it. She just wants it. 4. It's not fair to give her something for free when I have 4 siblings (my other sister and mom pay for stuff when they want that I bought) 5. It's not for her kids or anything. And the thing that keeps infuriating me is that she actively seeked me out on the website, when I didnt even offer and ask her if she wants it. (The reason I didnt ask her is because last time she wanted a play yard gate for her kids from me but wouldn't pay and played the same cards. Like I gave her 2 gates for free and she wants more and more) I had let her borrow those gates for her child and she didnt even return it when I had my other child. I had to keep moving sofas to block my child from getting out.

She keeps arguing about this and had taken the drawer without paying.  I told her I dont care how long she takes to pay but she will have to give me that $60. Now she wants to return the drawer to me because it reminds her of our fight. 

Am I the asshole? 

Please let me know so that I can show my family what you guys think. Thank you.My partner and I frequent a local restaurant for breakfast/brunch. Everyone around absolutely loves this place for its amazing food, great prices, and for the most part its staff. 

About a year and a half ago another local diner closed down and a couple of the long time waitresses were taken in by this other place. The owner is absolutely amazing and worked hard to make his new employees feel comfortable and at the same time trained them to meet the standards he expects of all of his employees. Except for one. While she is a lovely woman, she struggles a bit and honestly everytime she is our waitress we leave frustrated. She will often forget to put parts of our orders in, put in the wrong orders, forget to pick them up from the window, or forget about us altogether. We were once there for almost 3 hours because of the forgetfulness. 

It has gotten to the point that often other waitresses will try to step in and check her tables but when it gets busy that is sometimes not possible. Both my partner and I bartended/waited tables all throughout college and even professional school so we try to be patient. We also never tip badly although we may only do the minimum of 20% if it's a particular bad time.

My question is, would we be the assholes if we ask the hostess when we arrive to not sit us in this particular waitress' section? I do not want to take tips away from her but there are some days where we do not want to keep reminding our waitress that we still have not received water or have not received one of our dishes 20 minutes after everyone else has (has actually happened). I am not a confrontational person and I would of course like to avoid hurting her feelings so figured asking the hostess before we sat down would be best. 

Additional info: we have not complained to the owner as we don't want to cause trouble for her. One of our favorite waitresses has told us however that she has had complaints and the owner has tried to work with her. I believe that he can't bring himself to let her go as he truly is an awesome and big-hearted guy.I [19] was having a discussion with my older sister [22] about things that happened in the past and I told her, when I was in high school I've walked into her room stoned and she never figured it out. I was just teasing her but I didn't expect the reaction she had.

"Why do you think that's funny? You're disrespecting our family"

We then got into an argument about it.

She kept denying it was about her religion and that it was actually about our culture. 

I disagreed and pointed out that she's only saying this because of her religious beliefs. 

It pisses me off she acts like she's somehow progressive, when she's just as ass backwards as my parents  are and it's because of her religious beliefs.

Anyways, am I the asshole for getting stoned *outside* our house and walking in stoned? I never kept weed in the house btw.**EDIT: fixed the background. from what I can tell, there’s two sides: the one where I haven’t asked her “anywhere nice” and the part where she wants me to cut female friends out.**

Basically, I have a childhood friend who I know that I rarely hang out with (maybe once a year). We don’t talk that much on text either, but we still catch up every now and then. I go to college with my girlfriend, and we have been dating for half a year already. I have wanted to go to this restaurant (The Old Spaghetti Factory) and have asked my gf, but she didn’t really care for it so we never went. **EDIT: misremembered what actually happened, my gf feels like I don’t take her anywhere nice. I only asked her to eat there with me after she got upset at me about this. We never ended up going because it’s inconvenient since it’s out of town.**

I went home for break and I wanted to hang out with my friend. I told my gf this and she was okay with me, until when I told her I wanted to eat at the Old Spaghetti Factory. She thinks that it is a “datey” environment and is inappropriate and that it was nicer than anywhere we’ve been to (which is true but it’s a $15 normal meal restaurant!), and told me I can only go to a place where you order at the counter and not at the table. I told her that this was controlling and I got mad at her. Eventually, I ended up picking a sandwich shop so she’d be happy, but we still have arguments over who was right in this case.

My gf has insecurity and jealousy issues over me and girls, and I have already cut off 2 girls who I had SC streaks with before to make her happy. They were, however, 1) someone who I thought liked me but we were just friends and we only met once before ever, and 2) someone who I liked years ago but stopped. She wanted me to cut off another friend who we thought liked me, and she actually broke up with me for a bit bc she didn’t want me to keep cutting people off, but wanted to get back together hours later saying it was a mistake.

Anyways, My gf always has insecure and jealous moments and I have told her many times to fix it and I always hang out with her and let her read my texts but it always defaults to arguments over this.

She will also be reading this thread and we need some people to judge who is right about this.

Also my friend was 17 at the time, I am 21 and my gf is 22. My gf has never met her, and they both know about each other.I feel like this could be a potential "Get Off My Lawn" situation and I really don't want to be that person. So, WIBTA if I did?

My neighbor's gardeners come a couple times a week. They stay for about 4 hours, and for at least part of that time, they park in my driveway to unload their equipment, unload plants, mulch, etc. I'd say it's about an hour, sometimes two, each time they visit. This has been going on for a couple of years. I understand why they do it - the access to her backyard is easier from my driveway, parking in hers means walking along the front of her house to move stuff to the back. Parking in front of her house is not always available, but I notice even when it is, they still park in my driveway.

I work from home, and my desk looks out over the driveway, so I typically sit there, slightly annoyed but not seething, while they hang out. Dude was sitting there in my driveway in his truck, with motor running, eating lunch the other day. Today I was coming home and had to track down a guy to move the truck so I could pull up to my garage.

It probably wouldn't bother me so much, but lots of cars/trucks use my driveway to turn around, or block my driveway to deliver packages, etc. It's a particularly wide and convenient place to block. I'm honestly not overstating that, and that doesn't bother me because I understand and expect that. But I don't expect someone to hang there for an hour or so.

So, WIBTA if I politely asked them to stop doing this?So I was at the bus stop with my son, when a woman came with her daughter, she had a jacket on that came down to her waist, she had black skinny jeans on and I noticed a rip from the corner of my eye, I looked and around her butt next to the pocket seams she had 3 wholes in her jeans and I could see her butt cheeks and they were very noticeable sizeable holes. I’ve had moments when I’ve not realised I’ve got a hole in my jeans until I’ve got home and felt the bloody embarrassment, by the time I noticed it there was about 5 more people at the bus stop but I didn’t want to embarrass her more by saying it infront of them in case they heard.

Her daughter then ran off (as toddlers do) so I got up and followed her til we were a couple of feet away, I then whispered to her “hi, I’m sorry I just wanted to let you know that you have a couple of holes in your jeans in the bum area, I’ve got an old jumper in my bag if you want it, to tie around your waist?” She then got in my face and began shouting at me and got really nasty, I asked her to calm down and apologised for upsetting her but that wasn’t my intention, she then continued her abuse saying I had embarrassed her infront of everyone, another lady got involved and said no one had heard anything until she started shouting about everything, she continued bitching about it and shouting this lasted for ten minutes including an insult to my sun (who had just been hospital to get a cast removed) she began, making fun of him because of the dry skin due to the cast and I snapped and said “look I get you’re embarrassed but just fuck off, if you wanna walk around flashing your arse that’s fair enough but I’m not a fucking mind reader and if it were me I’d wanna know” I also told her she had better not say anything else about my son. 

She then started crying and said I didn’t know her situation etc, I told her we all go through hard times but it’s not an excuse to be abusive, she then said she had money troubles and I had £20 left in my purse so I offered her it, I’ve been there before when my finances are Rock bottom, shit I’m still there now but I had a spare £20, she then lost her shit even more then telling me she wasn’t a charity case etc etc so I told her simply if she continues down this path her pride will destroy her and the abusive she keeps giving will push people away, she called me a fucking bitch as the bus doors opened, one of  the other passengers told the driver what had happened and she was refused entry on the bus, I told him not to worry about it but he still refused to let her on in case she became abusive again, and guess what she became abusive over me saying that then she demanded the jumper I had offered her before and I said no.

I told my friend who said I should have given the jumper, had she asked nicely I would have but she abused me again and I didn’t feel she deserved my empathy anymore... so AITA?Okay so here is some background. I bought myself this anatomically correct heart necklace off amazon. It was a cheap thing made out of crap metal and only costed like $11 with shipping. Despite the low quality I love this necklace. I wore it all the time and never really changed it because I'm lazy when it comes to jewelry. Once i find something I like I wear it until I find something better.  Anyways, because of how much i wore this necklace it tarnished. The silver looking metal got that coppery look to it.

&#x200B;

My mom noticed and complained about it all the time, telling that it looked like it came from an antique shop, or that it looked old and dirty. I honestly didn't care that it tarnished or looked old, I actually kind of like the antique look so I kept wearing it. One day my mom told me to put the necklace in this jewelry cleaning solution she has to "clean it up" I put it in the solution (stupidly) and it came out worse. The necklace is made of cheap metal so the chemicals ate away at the remaining silver finish. At first I was upset but I got over it and continued to wear the necklace.

&#x200B;

About a day later my mom came to me with a small box and told me to open it, so I did. Inside was a new heart necklace. I was surprised at first, but she said she felt bad for telling to put it in the cleaner when she knew it would make the necklace worse so I thanked her and told her it was okay. It wasn't the same as my original or very similar to it but I appreciated the gesture. My mom asked if I liked it and I told her truthfully that I do like it, but I still like my other better even though it was tarnished. She asked why and told me it looked ugly and old and that hers was better. (I looked at it when first shopping but didn't like the simple frame of the heart style) I told her it just wasn't style but that i was still very grateful. She was slightly upset and told me she got me that one because she liked it better and thought it would look better on me because it wasn't chunky and gaudy like the old one. I thanked her again and wore the new necklace she got me for about  a month.

&#x200B;

After the month I thought it had been long enough so I started to wear my old one again. Nothing was said for awhile but my mom brought it up again saying "So you really don't like my necklace?" I again told her it was a very nice gesture but I prefer mine. I still wear mine daily but if we go out anywhere fancy I switch to hers because she thinks it looks nicer.

&#x200B;

I appreciate what she did but I didn't ask for the new necklace and was perfectly fine with the one I had. EDIT:she probably didn't ruin it on purpose. And while shopping she got one she liked, not one I would have liked. (She knew I didn't like that one because she watched me say no to it when I was first looking)  I really appreciate what she did, but it feels like a gift with expectations.My roommate (27F) and I (25F) have lived together since July 2018. We live in a 2b2b, but her room shares a wall with the kitchen. Around Feb 2019 she started to notice I was loud when going to the kitchen around midnight-2am. It wakes her up and then it "always" takes her "hours" to fall back asleep. Admittedly I was noisy at first, but ever since she told me about how loud it is I've been very careful. But even the gentlest closing of the fridge makes a noticeable thump in her room. She was really passive aggressive about it at first but eventually we came to an agreement. We bought a mini fridge and microwave for my room that I could use when she's asleep, she bought a door muffler that I put on my room door, silicone mat for my side of the kitchen counter to muffle noise. I agreed to avoid leaving my room whenever she's asleep.

This means I can't go to the kitchen at night to fill my Brita filter with water so I have to fill it slowly cup by cup in the bathroom sink. If I'm hungry at night, I can't eat anything that needs to be cooked on the stove or anything that is frozen because my mini fridge doesn't have a freezer. If I want to do the dishes, I have to do it before 10pm (when she goes to sleep), and I can't do it in the morning because I leave the house before she wakes up. When I want to pack my lunch for the next day, I need to put it in my mini fridge the night before so that I can access it before I go.

Lately I've been sleeping for 4-5 hours at night, then napping for 2 hours when I get back from work. Today, my "nap" ended up being a full blown 8hr sleep from 6pm-2am, and I woke up starving as I hadn't eaten since lunch the day before. I worked up the courage to go outside to the kitchen and open the freezer door ONE TIME to take out some frozen food. I took it back to my room and microwaved it in my room's microwave and haven't left my room since. Around 30min later, I get a passive aggressive text from her: "Could u try not going to the kitchen or try not make much noise in the middle of the night, it startles me and wakes me up, and I have trouble going back to sleep 😂😂"

I'm so pissed. I was out there for 5 min max. I feel like a prisoner in my own home where I cannot eat what I want or get water because I can't go to the kitchen. It’s not like she never wakes me up - she sometimes slams the apartment door. I can also hear the kitchen from my room and have awoken to her cooking breakfast a few times as well. I'm of the opinion that if you have slept for 7+ hrs every night for several nights, and then one night you get awoken after 5 hrs of sleep and can't fall back asleep, that's just your body telling you you're rested enough. 

She thinks it's my problem bc I don't have a normal set sleep time. WIBTA if I told her to get over herself and that I've already sacrificed a lot of my personal autonomy for her sleep problems.Hello, I'm a long time lurker and first time poster. I'm typing this on my phone in the bathroom, so bare with me.

A little bit of backstory:
All of the students were given and assignment to make a commercial thing for a book or author. You had to do partner work. About a day after, it was announced that we could no longer to partners, but after that, we were allowed to do partners again.


Today, when it was announced we could do partners again, my partners (3 other boys, I'm a girl) asked me if I still wanted to work. I said no as I had already started working on another book (The Evolution of Calpurnia Tate, I suggest you read it) They seemed fine with it and went on with their day.

Fast foward to lunch time and we're sitting at a table together. I hear them discussing that they needed to choose another book (We were doing Harry Potter, and I, a female, would be needed for most scenes) I started to feel kinda bad because they couldn't come to an agreement on a new book to do.

So reddit, Am I the asshole?I’m a Muslim, my religious book is called the Quran. It’s basically the Islamic version of the bible but sort of the extended/ part II edition. 

My stepmom and my dad are not Muslim. My dad has been inviting me last 3 weekends to his place because I’m doing some work on his car that’s saving him a LOT of money. I’m doing him the work for free and every fri evening-Saturday-Sunday I’m sacrificing my time to help. However I love him and he’s my dad so I don’t mind. 

I have been staying in the guest bedroom. I have only my tools, clothes, phone, phone charger, toiletries, and my Quran. It’s about the size of a normal bible. So not a lot of stuff. 

I keep it in my drawer and I didn’t think I was upsetting anybody by keeping in there. I’m visibly Muslim and my dad and stepmom know this. 

For some reason when I was working on my dads car she went into my room (not sure why) and decided to go INTO my drawer (again not sure why...) and she saw my Quran. She came downstairs and started passive aggressively snapping at my dad and I saying I wasn’t allowed to have it and to ‘get it out the house’ and ‘keep it in my car’ like it’s some kinda cursed artefact. 

She changed her tune after my dad told her she was being rude by saying that ‘I should have told them or asked if I could bring it with me’. I was like wtf. I don’t talk about my religion with them or try and convert or anything, and it’s a house I thought I was welcome in... why would I ask if I couldbring in my religious book that I only pray from when I’m in my room? 

I feel like I’m completely not the asshole, however my fiancé said she can kinda see their POV and now I’m just confused AF.I (23F) still live in my mum's house (55) with my younger sibling (12) and my mum's bf who recently moved in. (55?)

TL;DR at the bottom.

My mum is convinced I never do the dishes, I get in from uni and I immediately do them when I get home. I usually get home before my mum and it's not 30 mins before she tornadoes through the entire kitchen and uses everything I've just cleaned and get screamed at for not doing them even though it's literally her mess. If I get home after her, she greets me first only with a 'dishes' and then a hello and she has been telling her bf I don't do them when it's my chore - recently he's starting to get on my case.

&#x200B;

A few days ago it came to a boiling point when I arrived home minutes before mum and her bf did, hadn't even gotten my shoes off and settled. They both go to the kitchen to bring in bags when he looks at the sink and says "what's this here? look at this?" to my mum loudly so that I could hear, and I SWEAR tg. Who the fuck does this new housemate think he is not even here 4 weeks thinks he can start laying down the law?? More housemates mean more plates and I'm just in so I say to him, "I'll do them in a sec" and he rolls his eyes and I just flip and tell him that he has no place coming into my house and telling me they should be done and that if he's so concerned he could do them himself.

&#x200B;

Mum takes his side, and I say what should I do? When is the best time to do them because clearly anytime is no good. Get yelled at for waiting til after dinner to clean (I would like to do them before bed) but no, they must be done for when they get home. I sarcastically ask if I should just get up earlier just do to the dishes just for her, and they both are like yeah just w/e. 

&#x200B;

So this past week I've set my alarm at 02:00 when I know they usually do 'things' to wash the dishes. It's a small house so can hear everything. I put my alarm on max vol, wake up and turn on all the lights as I walk to the kitchen and leave the doors open and just wash the dishes. The first few days they didn't say a thing but today I got told to quit being difficult and go back to normal.

Bare in mind that I don't pay rent as I'm still a student and he does - I think I made a point but they are both annoyed at me and for my behaviour. Tbh if my mum never said "do the dishes" to me again the house would be much happier, literally every day do the dishes, do them. I do!! I don't mind doing them and I do every day it's just being told to do them while I'm about to do them makes me so annoyed. And don't get me started on the toothbrush incidents. I do think I was being an asshole but I think I was justified? Advice on what I should do?

TL;DR - Yelled at to have the dishes done for when they get home I comply but they don't agree, I move my dish washing time into the early hours when I know they'll being doing stuff to prove a point.(Backstory) my parents were divorced in the months before I was born and my dad (48M) never took an active role in my childhood, he didnt even meet me until I was 4 and did not become a bigger part of my life until I was 16, he also never paid child support or helped my mom with alimony. He had a long term gf (8-9 yrs) but she never knew about me and he confessed to me he had no intention of ever telling her. They broke up a little over a year ago and when he told me he said it was because he found someone new... she happens to be his co-worker's daughter (21F). They have been together a little over a year and he recently bought her a house.

I (also 21F) am graduating with my BA in May and he has told me some of his travel plans (my college is 5 hours from home) for the both of them (he plans to stay with some of her family in the area rather than book a hotel). I have asked him to help me and my mom pay for my class ring (about $1,100) and he agreed but has not given me any money yet. I really dont want her there, as I have only met her once and she was so nervous to meet me she decided to get sloppy drunk and complain to my dad that I wasn't interacting with her. My mom also doesnt want her there because why would she? She's also said if he bring the gf she wouldn't be able to keep her mouth shut about it, and I dont want any fighting on the day of my graduation. But I'm putting off telling him because I'm afraid he'll refuse to help me and my mom with my class ring, or worse, refuse to come.

I know he hasn't been part of my life and my bf thinks I shouldn't have invited him at all, but he's still my dad and since I came to college he has been a little helpful as far as textbooks and rent when I asked, so not having him there would hurt a little and also break my grandma's (his mom, who has been a big part of my life) heart.

WIBTA for asking him not to bring her?

Edit: lots of comments and suggestions about telling him there's a limited number of tickets, but there's not. My college says we have unlimited guests because we're graduating in pretty big stadium... that has a capacity of 30,000. So I could tell him theres not many tickets but my guest list so far would not be reflective of that, lol. Including both sides of my family and close friends, my guest list is at about 30 people 😅 So he could show up the day of and see I've invited my pastor and my bf's parents (because I think I've spent more time with them than with him) and call me out on the lie.I’m only having one college friend in my wedding party as well as my two sisters and my fiancé’s sister. She’s the friend that I’m the closest to now.

We want even bridal parties and my fiancé is only having 4 guys. We also want to keep the parties on the smaller side. I’m still planning on inviting everyone to my bachelorette and every other celebration, although they’re under no obligations at all.

I had a larger group in college (5 girls) but we were more close in name than actually hanging out a lot. If I did one I’d have to have them all, but one of them recently made a comment about how hurt they all are that they’re not my bridesmaids and my other friend from college is. Info: we were in separate friend groups.

AITA for not just including everyone in my bridal party? I don’t see us being close in 10 years which is how I’m trying to think about things, but I also do care about them and don’t want to hurt anyone. I see how they might be hurt as I think they always thought we were a little closer than I feel we are.My partner and I have relatively large extended families and friends throughout the province who will almost all (70%) have to drive a fair distance (2-7 hours) to attend our weddding. We have a list of around 130 guests. 

We are really into the outdoors and want to pick a venue that reflects who we are. We are thinking of doing a 'summer camp' style wedding instead of straight up camping, since we understand many elderly guests and non-outdoorsey types may not enjoy, and while it is important to us to find a venue that is meaningful and personal, we get it's not for everyone.

It would be 5 Friday until noon Sunday. Guests would have accommodation for the weekend. They would be in bunks or single beds sharing their room with 1 other person (I.e. their plus one). Families would have multi person cabins. Elderly guests would have actual cabins. Shower facilities and bathrooms are shared. The price would include all you can drink beer and wine from arrival Friday to departure sunday at noon. It would also include food for the entire weekend and access to swimming/kayaking/canoeing etc. Food includes full breakfasts (not continental), catered lunch, caesar bar, pizza, marshmallows for the fire. We would supply things like toilet paper, bug spray, ice, wet wipes, flashlights etc. The price we are looking at charging, per person, is $265. Kids under 18 would be free. 

Both of our families (and many of our friends) have had destination weddings in the past (i.e. $1600 for 7 days, not including activities or anything on the resort). They were heaps of fun and it is amazing to have everyone together, but we also want something that is accessible and affordable to everyone we wish to be there.

The price does NOT cover any of the actual day of the wedding (I.e. cocktail hour, reception, photography, florist, open bar etc). I am not trying to recoup costs. We anticipate around 60% of our guests will need to stay for the weekend (distance etc.)

WIBTA if we charge guests to $265pp stay the weekend?TLDR; I decorated my Christian “Gma”s room with everything she likes. Now tries to say I can’t decorate my own room with things I like because she “doesn’t believe in it”. 

OL and me are, generally, on pretty good terms and we have a really strong bond- at least, for as much as one of those can exist between moral polar opposites. I’ve lived here for years now; I was married with her adoptive (grand)son and he basically ditched the both of us. But it’s a mutually beneficial situation. I’m like a live-in caretaker/maintenance guy. 

I only just came out to myself about who I am after oppressing it for years. I am a trans man, and I like women. That’s honestly been a massive positive change in my life. I’m much happier and healthier now I’m acknowledging that. I told OL this, and albeit reluctant and with difficulty, she really tries to be understanding and even somewhat supportive. I really appreciate that. 

I myself am very much a believer in letting people do what they want/enjoy as long as it doesn’t harm anyone, and so I don’t say a word about OL enjoying her Christian stuff. I respect and support it. I’m happy that she has something she enjoys and a community around her, and I would be lying if I said I wasn’t a little jealous about that last one. 

And for OLs birthday, I even took things a small step further. 

She had a fairly boring bedroom without much personality, and so instead of buying a thoughtless gift I splurged on Aliexpress and spent weeks making things to spruce up her room. Flowers, butterflies, cats, and bible quotes, she was crying of joy and gratefulness when she got the reveal. 

But this made my own room look really rather bland. All I have is a set of GOT banners, not even a place to display stuff. And so I started looking for stuff that I liked. Art, wallstickers, a pride or trans flag, band merch, stuff like that. 

And she hated it. (Which is, of course, her right).But then she said she ”wouldn’t allow it in the house because she doesn’t believe in it” and “it’s evil” which is what doesn’t sit right with me. Like I don’t believe in the bible but I carefully pasted a quote onto her wall. But especially her aversion to me getting a flag gets to me. It feels quite invalidating tbh. 

And it would be on the complete opposite side of the house. Behind the bedroom door, a long ass hallway, and a curtain. She’d literally never see it unless she would invite herself into my room? Almost every moment in my life is soaked in Christianity. My room is my sanctuary. It’s where I don’t have to censor myself and can listen to what I enjoy. 

I understand that she’s the one paying the rent, but I also understand that if it weren’t for me being here the house would be a mess and she would be eating canned soup every day.

So, in conclusion; WIBTA for getting the stuff I want anyways? Especially since she probably wouldn’t even know it’s there? I almost feel tempted to go a step further and get a TST flag, to be honest, but I won’t.I live with my boyfriend of a year. We started living together after two months of dating since it was already a plan of ours before we got together. Recently we moved into this new apartment and my cat isn’t necessarily on the agreement. Well, we have those blinds that are vertical and kind of clack together and dangle. She likes to push them out of the way to see and just relax. Well my boyfriend has recently been yelling at her, scaring her, threatening to put her in a crate, and throwing small objects at her. I’m getting fed up with it so I got curtains and pushed the blinds out of the way so she can’t ruin them which was his main concern. But he’s still mad at her for it because “she’ll ruin them regardless”. He was never mad at her for looking out the window at previous apartments. Recently it has us arguing to the point that he won’t even listen to my side or just say he’s done talking about it. Am I wrong for wanting my cat to have the freedom to look out of the window in a small apartment?

Edit: By small objects I meant bottle caps, socks, and paper balls. Sorry for not clarifying.In the morning my father dropped me off to the gym and I walked in barefoot. Later when we were going someplace to eat, he told me never to do it again and I didn't respond. He got pissed off and turned back home. I didn't think it was a big deal and was surprised it took him so long to bring up if he felt like it was important enough to tell me to never do again. Also, I had my socks and shoes in hand and I've been going to the same gym all my life and I know all the people there, but I'm not saying it's ok to walk in places barefoot. Anyways, am I an asshole for not responding? If you were me or my father what would you have done.From the day I was born until I was 11, I shared the same room with my parents because my brother had occupied the room. When he moved out, it was mine! I had my own space and I was content with that. My dad would come in from time to time to check up on me to see what I was doing but I was okay with that at the time because I liked spending time with my dad.

When I was 14, a traumatic event happened that changed the course of my relationship between my dad and I, and he became overprotective. At the time, I enjoyed the overprotectiveness because it made me feel secure when the event happened in my home. I became more antisocial because of it and only stayed home.

Now, I'm a sophomore in college and I want to blossom from an antisocial caterpillar into a social butterfly! I'm 19 (20 in April) and I want to go to parties, hang out with friends, and enjoy myself because I want to experience things and not live in fear and anxiety for the rest of my life. Here's where the issue comes in. My dad likes to check in a lot (way too much) to the point where my friends don't want me to come hang out with them if it's gonna bother my dad that I'm not home. He sees me as his little girl, I get that, but it's frustrating because I want to have fun and playing video games and being stuck in my room all the time isn't fun.

Another thing, my room has never had a lock on it at all. I wasn't bothered by my dad barging in my room when I was younger, but now that I want some sort of privacy and independence, it's frustrating. I'll be sitting in my room doing homework or reading and then all of a sudden he'll barge in. "Whatcha doing?" as he sits on my bed to look at my laptop or television. It happens every day, multiple times per day. My answers are always the same.

My mom and I have sat down with him to talk about privacy and independence but he gets defensive and angry which upsets me. He doesn't listen and he'll do it again. Whenever he gets defensive he usually says "well don't talk to me ever again" as he storms off angrily. That's not what I want at all, I just want to set some boundaries that are comfortable for the both of us. I'm not his little girl anymore and I don't want to keep being seen as that.

Tomorrow, I have an event at my college from 6pm - 8pm and my class finishes at 11:30 so I was going to go home and go back. I told my dad as a 'heads up' case and the first thing he tells me is "oh, i'll come with you!" I'll tell him no, that I want to go alone. "don't worry! I want to. Mom will come too!"

WIBTA if I set some healthy boundaries between my dad and I.

I don't think I would be, but the only reason that I could possibly be TA would be by making my dad defensive and angry; that would be my fault for bringing the conversation up again in the first place.

I'm tired of walking on eggshells to please my dad. I'll always be daddy's girl, I just want space.A few months ago my wife started seeing a doctor for spinal decompression (she has some disc problems). The doctor’s office we are seeing isn’t in-network (IN), but when I called them the admin person I spoke with (let’s call them K) said they would bill us as if we were IN. I said that IN cost for PT is a $30 copay, no deductible (D). 

We begin sessions, and they start billing insurance. It’s taking a long time, and K tells us each session they're still waiting. I keep telling them that in-network is a $30 copay. 15 sessions later…

I'm alone in the waiting room when K tells me that insurance says the cost will be $130+ per session as my D for the year hasn't been met yet, and they’ll reduce that to $50+. I state that I do not have a D for IN PT visits and that we had agreed that it would be $30 per session. K insists that that’s not the case, and I equally insist that it is. That’s when K gets heated, saying things like “so you think we just shouldn’t be paid for our work?”, “How are we supposed to make money if we just don’t charge people?”, “So you think you just shouldn’t have to pay what you owe?”

I respond as calmly as possible that that isn’t my problem and we agreed that I would pay IN costs for my wife's treatment.

K exclaims, “Fine! We’ll charge you $30 per session and I guess we’ll just turn the lights off,” sits down in a huff, and says, “some people!”

At which point I stand up and say that isn’t fair, and your overhead isn't my problem. I ask to see the doctor, and K responds, “go ahead.”

In the doc’s office, I tell them we have a problem and summarize the situation. The doctor apologizes, says they’ll make it right. I say thank you and walk out.

I exit the main office because I need to cool down some, call my insurance, and confirm the IN costs. I then reiterate them to K when I walk back inside. K says “Fine,” does some math, and then says I owe $480. 

“As in, I need to pay you $480 today?”, (we’re 16 sessions in by now). K says yes. I ask if there is a payment plan option, which K grudgingly says yes to. I say I’d like to do that.

K shuffles some papers, then states, “And just so you know, after this session the cost will change.” To which I respond, “No it won’t, my wife's treatment plan isn’t finished.” K again scoffs in outrage and exclaims, “some people!"

I later call my insurance again. The agent says what would normally happen if I was IN is that I would pay the copay, insurance would negotiate a rate, and the doctor's office would argue the rate. What seems to have happened is that K is using the negotiated rate as IN cost.

Further, my wife checked their google reviews and discovered a 1-star review left by someone else that could have been written word-for-word by me, including a description of K becoming increasingly combative when challenged.

So, AITA here for standing my ground? Or am I being unreasonable?I’m a supervisor at my job. In my department, we “need” to get a certain amount of credit card applications a week in order to meet standards.

I put “need” in quotes because while they do 
ride us pretty hard about it, few people actually make the number (it’s unrealistically high) and they have never severely reprimanded someone for not making it. It’s mostly just annoying for the people under my management. I guess it’s more strict for myself and other supervisors since we are in charge.

We have self checkout, but are expected to help and ask for credit cards. I was ringing out the perfect customer to ask for credit - he had a lot of expensive items in his cart, which is why I was helping him out.

I had just finished ringing him out and was about to shoot my spiel about applying for cards, when my coworker (who is beneath my management) who had been watching me check out asked him herself and he said yes.

She almost stepped in front of me to help him apply, but we had a weird moment of “who should take credit for the application”. She told me she asked him so she should, but then I told her that I was about to ask anyways, so she let me do the app.

After we were done, she told me she has 0 credit apps this week. I also had 0 apps this week.

In her defense, she DID ask him, and she needed the credit app.

However, I felt like she hopped on last minute to something I was already doing/about to do. Plus, I needed the app too.

AITA for doing the app instead of her?On mobile so apologies for grammatical and formatting errors. 

So I've been working on a book for the better part of two years. It's constantly a work in editing progress, part of it is I want to produce something I am truly pleased with, and perhaps a tad bit of I don't think it's very good or that I am all that good so it's a prebuilt in excuse that I never have to actually attempt to publish it because it's not "finished". I suppose you could say I get extremely anxious at the thought of it being rejected or someone not liking it. I'm aware this is irrational but it is what it is. I write because I enjoy writing I don't need to be a published author to do something that I enjoy. I'm very private about it as well, my BF knows all of this and though he has asked in the pat to read it I've adamantly stated I do not want him to.

Now I do take partial ownership in this as I don't normally lock my laptop when I am at home I would think for obvious reasons. Last night I was working on it for the whatever insane time again rewriting a section when I had to go out for 30 minutes to run a quick errand. When I came back I found him hovering over my laptop reading it. I asked what he was doing and he stated that he was reading my book and he didn't like the rewrite he liked the original scene better. 

I burst into tears because I was upset that he had obviously been reading it for a while after I had asked him not to. He, of course, didn't see what the big deal was and said as much saying it was good why was I upset? I felt utterly betrayed so snatched up my laptop and left the room. 

So he know thinks I overreacted and was an AH for grabbing my laptop from him. I feel though he broke my trust and did something I deliberately have asked him not to. 

TL:DR BF read my manuscript and invaded my privacy after being asked not to. In response, I snatched my laptop from him and am now upset over it all.Let’s start with some background first. This is my husbands aunt. My husband does not like her because she is not a good person. I could list a number of shitty things she’s done, but that’s a whole other story. I don’t like her because she has talked bad about me twice behind my back and used my husband a number of times. I didn’t say anything out of respect for my husband and his mother. Well, my husband mentioned that his Aunt who invited herself to a cook out at our house, knowing she’s not welcome, that his Aunt wants to have her Easter party at our house. Her two sons are mentally challenged as are the other kids that would be here. I know it wouldn’t be for her but her sons, but I do not want her at our house. There are also some children who have issues with animals and can’t be left alone with them. We have a dog and a bird, I don’t want to put our animals in that kind of situation. I also don’t know any of the people that would come besides my husbands family. I told my husband that it was a hard NO, that I did not feel comfortable with having a party at our home and that I didn’t want his aunt thinking she’s ok to be at our house. My husband agreed and left it at that, but I’m wondering if I am the asshole for not allowing a children’s party at our home. I just don’t want any fighting and arguments.My sil(24) hates me(mtf 26) with a passion ever since my fiance(22) started dating me four years ago. There was no fight or argument between us and I was honestly hurt when I found out as I've always been under the impression that we got along reasonably well enough. During their upbringing she also was an incredible cruel sister to my fiance. My fiance is suffering from depression and borderline disorder since her early teens, now all of a sudden I get blamed for it. She brought it up on multiple occasions that I'm ruining her sisters life and that everybody would be a better partner for her. I'm paying our rent all by myself ever since we moved together and I helped her to get into college and to find a new major after she dropped out of her old one during a severe depressive episode. Last year my sil invited my sister over to discuss something important. Lo and behold it was an hour long speech about how I'm the most terrible person in existence, how her entire family hates me(they don't), that she never wants to see me ever again and that I'm uninvited from her wedding. Last week my fiance gets a call from her mother to discuss the wedding of her sister, when they're going to go shopping for dresses and so on. After a bit of an argument my fiance decided to attend her sister's wedding as it would cause a major family feud if she wouldn't go. As we're also currently planning our wedding we went over the invitation list and decided both that we don't want her sister to attend as she surely would cause a scene. WIBTA for uninviting her? 

tl;dr WIBTA for uninviting my sil from our wedding after she uninvited me from hers and after years of being a bitch to both me and my fiance?I (31F) moved a few hours away from my family 3 years ago. The move was great for my career and personal life. No regerts. My little brother started to tell people that I abandoned the family and I thought I was too good for them after I moved. I confronted him about it after a couple months of him saying it to anyone who would listen whenever he got drunk. He told me he didn’t feel that way; I reminded him that I saw them more after I moved than when I was in town, I was there for him no matter what and he could call or visit whenever he wanted. He said we were good and I believed him. 

Turns out I was wrong when he showed his ass a year later on his first visit to my place. He started a massive fight about how I didn’t care about my family, I thought I was better than them but I wasn’t as great as I thought. My mother convinced me not to kick him out after he backed down. He apologized that morning so I moved on.

Last week, my aunt started to lecture me about how I didn’t do enough to maintain a relationship with him. She told me he felt abandoned and jealous/insecure about how much I made and how well I was doing. I explained the history only to hear that I need to be the bigger person, keep pushing him and reach out even when he says he’s okay. 

I’m over the petty drama. I’m not going to take a giant pay cut, leave my partner, friends, and career behind so he has a punching bag that’s closer to home. I’m going to sit him down again and explain that he needs to decide how much his hurt feelings and pride are worth to him. If he has a reasonable request for me on how to rebuild, I’ll hear him out if it brings an end to this nonsense. If he can’t put this shit behind him, then I’m done. 

AITA for ending the relationship if he can’t get his inferiority complex in check?My(21) GF(21) recently told me that she met an old friend (Male and i guess also 21) with whom she didn't have any contact since primary school or so. I was quite happy for her since she is really introverted. So after meeting him at a party they decided to exchange their gamertags and started gaming together for a week or so. He invited some of his friend and they play with my girlfriend which doesn't bother me because my GF plays a lot of videogames (she's even better than me) and she used to play with other friends of hers and even played in a clan. She plays videogames for fun though. After playing with him for a couple of times she started telling me how much fun it was and told me what they were talking about while gaming and so on. Somehow I got really jealous not because she was playing videogames with other guys but she was really ehtusiastic about it and kept telling my how cool it was playing with him and his friends. So maybe out out jealousy i said to her that im not interested in listening to her anymore.
I know I sounded kinda harsh but since then she basically ignores me and it gives me more anxiety that maybe she lost interest in me.
AITA for telling that im not interested?
PS: This is my first reddit post and I literally had to google "how to create a post on reddit mobile" because I'm stupid and don't understand how reddit works.Hey everyone. I’m in my mid 20s, same as my bf. We have been together for a year and a half. A few months ago he heard of the possibility of a job opening a state away. It would double his income and he’d be able to get out of this city. We talked about it and I was on the fence about moving. Recently he heard he may have the opportunity to get this job sooner than we thought. We talked and I agreed that I’d move with him. I didn’t know what I was doing with my university or future so i couldn’t find a reason not to move. However, he was told it may be pushed back a couple months now (if it even happens- it’s his friend trying to get him a job at his work). 

Recently I found a program in that city I am super excited for. It’s a masters program that would allow me to do the exact work I want to do, but there is the option of doing it online. I spoke to an advisor at my university and she suggested an independent research study I could conduct that would not only help my chances of getting into this masters program, but could help me get into the line of work beforehand. I have contacts here for the work I want to do, and if I could get this research project actually implemented into the field, I could excel my career and make a name for myself, allowing employment faster. 

I told my bf last night and he kept saying I could find the field and make contacts out there. I told him that I already have all the contacts out here who could help me get the resources I need because of our relationship and my previous employment in the field. He just argued that I could do it out there just as easy (which no, it wouldn’t be as easy). I told him I think it would be best for my career to stay. He got really upset.

I understand where he is coming from. I promised to move with him IF and WHEN he got this job, but he was promised the job before Christmas, then before March (and obviously that’s not going to happen). If I want to do this independent study, I need to start arranging things now, I can’t really put it off, because I need to find a prof who is willing to take me on. He also is upset because I have a fully furnished place and he only has a bed and dresser at his, so he didn’t want to buy an entire apartments worth of furniture for out there. 

Am I the asshole for finally finding my passion at an inconvenient time and going back on my word?  I want the best for him and his career, but I also need to think about myself. I have another 2 years of my undergrad and then it would be 2 years of masters, which I could do here or there. But I think given my opportunity to do this study, it would be best to stay here. I could even ask if I could intern at the organization while I do the study, to help them even more, and in return it would help my career.


TLDR; my bf wants me to move to another state with him for a possible job opportunity. I want to stay because it would be best for my possible career. He’s mad I’m backing out at last minute because I found this opportunity.Two of my co-workers (including my manager) work part-time. They usually arrive at around 9am and leave at 2pm. It's quite naturally that especially my manager's schedule is pretty tight. 

Lately she started scheduling lots of meeting at 12pm which is my usual lunch break time. I'm having pretty good connections with my co-workers from other departments so we always get ready to have lunch at that time. In the beginning I was hesitant to refuse my manager's requests. So if I attended her meetings and returned at around 1pm my co-workers had already eaten and I was mostly left alone. Lots of times I can't even get lunch cause lots of my own meetings and calls start around 1pm straight until the end of the day so I'm left hungry until 5 or 6pm while my manager leaves at 2pm for lunch at home. We have pretty flexible working times but most of people are usually present between 9 and 5.

Today I finally snapped and refused to accept the appointment because I had a lunch appointment I planned and looked forward to for a long time. I explained them that I work in full-time, I need my lunch break at around noon otherwise I won't be able to function properly. My part-time co-worker immediately felt offended and claimed I have a personal problem with her and my manager.

I'm home now & starting to feel bad about my reaction. Am I the asshole for refusing to adapt to my co-workers' shorter time frame while sacrificing my lunch break?So I live in Los Angeles and every morning I nanny for a few hours for four children (7 mo old, 4 yr old, 6 yr old, 8 yr old). We go for walks almost every morning and there aren’t many  sidewalks in their neighborhood so we only have so many paths we can take. Well, there’s one car that seems to always park in their own driveway which obviously should be alright except for their driveway is not big enough for a car unless the garage is used but they don’t use it apparently so they’re blocking the sidewalk to the point where everyone walking has to walk in the street to get by. If it was just me walking I wouldn’t even probably have a second thought about it but because I’m with three young children walking and have a fourth child in a stroller I do rely on us using the sidewalks for their safety. I also have noticed one of the times that a note was left for this car not to block the walkway but maybe they just don’t care. I should also add that right in front of their house is street parking and their is tons more around their whole neighborhood. There’s no apartments nearby, it’s all single family homes so there’s no shortage of street parking whatsoever. So today I called parking enforcement and they said they’d send someone out which means this car will most likely be receiving a ticket I assume. Am I an asshole? I hate tickets, I just got a $73 street sweeping ticket a few weeks ago because I left my damn car on the street sweeping side and rode my bike to work instead 🤦‍♀️ I broke a rule and so I sucked it up and paid the price. I’m pretty sure this person knows that they shouldn’t be blocking the sidewalk day in and day out but I do feel bad now that I called on them. Idk, parking enforcement hasn’t come yet, should I knock on the door and tell them to move?Happened about 3 minutes ago. 

I’m getting onto the train and see an empty seat. I finally get to sit down as this line is usually packed. So, I take the seat.
Apparently, this old guy wanted the seat and I sat down before him. 

“You’d take a handicapped mans seat???”

Huh? But there were three open seats next to each other... and the seat I took was the farthest away from him so...??? 

He also took an entire seat for his backpack which you aren’t allowed to do...

I just rolled my eyes and some guy got up and gave the old man his seat then says “nice job” to me. Wtf did I do? AITA?

Edit: I did not sit an a priority seat! Those were all taken.So my step sister has just started to learn how to drive, she has her permit and likes to think she knows a lot.  I have been drivings dune buggies and dirt bikes since I was like 8.  I drive us to school every day and she has made a habit of criticizing every little turn I make.  It’s gotten to the point where driving her is unbearable 

Recently she was telling me to brake cause she thought I was gonna hit a car.  I have had enough of her BS so I slammed on the breaks as hard as I could making the whole car jolt stop and scared her.  We still had like 10 minutes to school and she basically cussed me out the whole way there.  My friends are saying that was a dick move but I don’t really think it was that bad.  AITA?I (25M) have a brother (30M) and a sister (21F). We were all raised well and are doing well in life. My sister is in her third year of undergrad at a great school. I catch up with her quite often and she said she’s doing well in school. She doesn’t have a traditional part-time job, but she’s building her social media presence as a model/influencer and seems to be doing well in that department. She advertises for a few brands, ranging from bikinis to energy drinks. I don’t have a problem with that. However last week, she advertised on her Instagram Story her new Patreon page where people can pay for exclusive and uncensored content. That just doesn’t seem like something that she would resort to, but alas here we are. My parents and older brother don’t have Instagram so they don’t know that she’s baring herself to make money. 


I wanted to talk to her about it so I treated her out to dinner Sunday night. I didn’t mention her Patreon page until our car ride back to her apartment. I couldn’t do it over dinner. I asked her why she made a Patreon page. She said that she noticed many other models doing the same and wanted to test it out for herself. I asked her if she doesn’t care what our family or other people will think of her. She said that people shouldn’t make it such a big deal because she’s not hurting anybody. I told her that frankly I’m a little disappointed that she’s resorting to selling her body to make money and that our parents would definitely be too if they found out. She joked that our parents would be happy that she put the boob job they bought for her to good use. I didn’t expect her to crack the joke, but I told her that our parents definitely wouldn’t want her posing topless for money. I told her that her swimwear, lingerie, and censored topless photos are fine, but to show every detail of her boobs is totally not classy and she should heavily consider stop doing what she’s doing. 


She told me that she doesn’t tell me how to live my life so I shouldn’t tell her how to live hers. I was sure she hasn’t told our parents yet, but I asked her anyways. She said that she hasn’t and that they didn’t need to know. I told her that they would most likely stop paying her tuition if they find out, since they already aren’t too pleased with her diverting attention away from her studies to work on her social media presence. She said that whatever happens, happens. I knew I couldn’t get her to stop, so I stayed quiet until she said that it was inappropriate for me to even talk about her being topless in the first place. I told her to stop being silly trying to defend what she’s doing. She raised her voice to tell me how she’s not doing anything wrong. I pretty much just stayed quiet until I dropped her off at her apartment. We haven’t contacted each other since then.I already know the answer to this, I just want everyone to tell me what a bitch I’ve been. 

My daughter was born 3 years ago. After 36 hours in labor I had a csection. After I had trouble breastfeeding, my milk never came in properly and after 2 months of pumping and supplements and praying and crying we gave up and switched to formula completely. I had my son 3 months ago, via section. I tried breastfeeding but again it didn’t work. I gave up quicker this time, and we are using formula. 

My MIL has spent the last 3 years crowing about my failures as a mother. All her children were born naturally. She had no trouble breastfeeding. Csections are for quitters. Her body was just made to be a mother, but don’t worry dear, I’m sure you’re good at other things. Blah blah blah. It’s ramped up with the new baby. Every time I see her, which has been a lot, just little passive aggressive digs at me. My husband has asked her to stop, my FIL told her to stop, but she just plays dumb. For 3 years I kept quiet to her face, but she made me cry more than once in private. There was a little while, about 2 weeks post partum, where I went to a seriously dark place and questioned whether she was right, whether I shouldn’t have become a mother and if they would be better off without me. I’m feeling better now, and those feelings aren’t all her fault, but she sure didn’t help. 

Important info, my husband has 2 brothers. His mom had a late term miscarriage of her only daughter, and she always wanted a girl. 

Anyway, this past weekend they were over for dinner and my husband was feeding the baby. She starts in loudly about how she never needed bottles because she made so much milk, and how she guessed she was just such a natural mother, and how it just seems so wrong to give a baby formula, and she was such a perfect mother, practically a fertility goddess, and I was such a failure. 

I’m sleep deprived and hormonal and I’ve put up with this for years and I just snapped. I said 

“At least all my babies are alive”. 

As soon as it came out of my mouth I wished I could stuff it back in. She got real quiet and they left pretty quick after without really saying anything. 

I firmly believe I’m the asshole, but my husband thinks she deserved it after all the pain she intentionally caused me. So tell me, YTA or what?

ETA: so I’m really surprised at how all over the board my judgement has been. Thanks to all the other moms who’ve told me their stories, it makes me feel better about how I’m doing. 

By all means, I get how mean what I said was. It actually surprised the hell out of me, and I feel ashamed I said it. I definitely need to work on addressing behaviour like this from people before it comes to a head like that. Also I think I’m going to take a break from seeing my MIL for a while, it’s probably for the best. 

I’m really sorry to anyone who reads this who has experienced baby loss. I can’t imagine your pain and I know I’m a shit heel. It definitely won’t happen again. ❤️💔Background: My Dad was an aholic, his sober was drunk. My parents divorced when I was 6, he'd run the family business into the ground with strippers and booze. He was 'gone' a lot after that. The summers he was around and I was still young enough to pawn off he would always convince my mom he was doing GREAT and I'd end up in a crack house or alcohol hovel for the summer. I learned how to freebase at the ripe age of 14 by watching him. He mostly disappeared after that. He showed back up once I was an adult and I ended up letting him live with me for a while, but I kicked him out after he stole my car. I called the police after a week to report it, it had been in impound for 3 days. 500 dollars later I had a car with two flats and the backseat removed. I still ended up with his POA because he "needed me" until he fatally OD'd. He literally stole a 20$ from me that last day I ever saw him, which was to bring him groceries.

Anyways on to the issue. Since his death, every year or so I run into someone, usually at a gas station or in line at the store, that wants to reminisce. No matter how I react these interactions tend to throw me off all day. Probably because these people get so pushy? They'll tell me a story where they thought he was oh so fun and then expect me to tell my own and go on about how I miss him. I used to respond with "I'm glad you had that experience" or " That's sounds like it was a great time" but that's NEVER enough for them. They always want me to tell my own story and commiserate. I've gone full blown honest in response.

"Did you know he got me a camaro for my 16th birthday? It didn't work and you could see the street through where the floorboards used to be, but he got it for cheap from his crackhead girlfriend for the 300$ he said he'd contribute to my car savings. That money went missing after he'd come by so it was a good thing he got me a car already!"

"My favorite time together was probably when the show Cops was in town. He'd gone to the grocery store the day before and when he got home that night he was so fucked up he managed to shut the door latch while it was open and set the car alarm off at the same time. We spent an hour of me fixing it while he danced around and sung the bad boys theme waiting for the TV crew. "

stories like that. All true, but the surprised pikachu face is usually what I get and I go on my way.

It happened again today but instead of a story I just kind of blarghed.

Random lady: "Oh he was just such a charming guy, I bet you miss him"

Me: "Probably not as much as the impound lot, or his old drug dealers but I suppose in my maladaptive moments show through sometimes"

this lady went on a full on tirade about speaking ill of the dead and how I'm an asshole for dragging his name through the mud after he's gone.

AITA for ruining people's perception of my dead father and not just kowtowing to polite conversation?  


edit: spellingSo, this happened awhile back but I still think about the scenario often. 

I took my daughter to a birthday party that had a bouncy house. She is 4 years old, but acts pretty grown up and hates any rough kind of play. She is fairly close with the girl who’s birthday it was as she goes over there to play with her one on one pretty often (dads work together). 
So, the birthday girl took a break from the bouncy house and went inside for a bit with some of the other kids and they were all playing on her iPad... after a bit it was taken away and the kids were told to go back out and utilize the bouncy house before they brought out the cake. My daughter followed, but the kids were all a little bigger than her and she wound up falling and bumping heads pretty hard with another kid. 

I knew it was an accident but naturally I felt bad. I allowed her to go inside and sit on the couch for a bit. She was watching Frozen on my phone, when another mom came up and snatched it from her and told her she needs to go out and play with the other kids. I was sitting outside of the door and she came running out, visibly shocked and upset. I went to the door to try to figure out what happened and the mom stated “I took it away and told her she needs to go play like the other kids”. I awkwardly just kinda let it go, and took my daughter off to the side and played catch with her until she had recovered from the head bumping incident and was ready to go back to the bouncy house. 

The mom refused to make eye contact with me or speak to me for the rest of the party. While I do see her side of things, I kinda felt like it wasn’t her place to make this decision

AITA for allowing her to do this at a birthday party?Let's get to the point. I'm the CEO of a small technology startup, think <50 employees. We give each employee a laptop on which they can do programming work. 

I try to be a reasonable guy and let people work from home if they're more comfortable but because every company I've started has had "mysterious equipment disappearances" I've installed software on each computer for monitoring. **Each employee was informed of the full nature of the monitoring in their employee contracts**

Occasionally, as is my right, I'll log into the monitoring software website to monitor the status of the equipment that *I paid for* What do I find? People watching TV or slacking off instead of working, fine whatever. But very occasionally I see people who are on their company computers while not-fully-dressed. 

I'm not an old school guy but I'm flustered by the fact that people can't seem to manage to even dress themselves before starting work. Even my 7 year old knows how to get fully dressed in the morning before school, why can't these people?

I told my CTO enough is enough and I want to send out an email reminding everyone about our (already very lax and permissive!) dress code. Jeans, sweat pants, T-shirts, that's all good by me as long as you're fully dressed while working. Instead of having my back, my CTO who I've known for years popped a few blood vessels yelling at me not to send the email and not to ever mention this again to anyone. 

I don't think I'm asking too much, but WIBTA if I send out that email?So my brother and I share a 2 bed 1 bath apartment and this morning my gf and I were just getting up when he went into the shower and preceded to take 45 minutes to shower and 15 minutes to shave, totalling an hour while we were laying there needing to use the bathroom. So after he was done I went to him and talked to him.

M: Why do you need to take an hour in there?

B: I-I was shaving

M: How does it take you a fucking hour to shower and shave?

B: Well I like my long showers

M: Well stop with them, there's no reason for you to be taking that long in there.

B: Okay, okay

Like I get the appeal of taking a ling shower, but to me that's absolutely ridiculous, especially when you /know/ there's other people there. And yes, I have asked him to try and take shorter showers but apparently he didn't listen. I'n starting to consider getting our mom involved to see if he would listen to her. AITA for chewing him out over it? And WIBTA to get mom involved?I'm a very introverted person, I love my alone time. My girlfriend (wonderful lady) is extremely extroverted and outgoing.

We've been dating for a bit over a year and in her perfect world we'd spend 90% or more time together and see each other basically every day.

In my ideal world we'd spend the day together about 3 times or so a week. As our relationship has been progressing spending time with her feels more and more like spending time alone and isnt nearly as draining so I've been spending usually about 4-5 days a week with her for most of the day.

The first thing she asks me every morning is "do you wanna do something today?". Shell ask me this even if I said the day before that I just wanted a day to myself.

This doesnt really bother me but she gets upset everytime I want to be alone. Shes not mad at me just disappointed that she wont get to see me. So I told her, I give myself 3 days to myself every week, so why dont you just pick the 4-5 days per week that we see each other.

That way she doesnt get the disappointment of rejection and I get my alone time. This really upset her and thinking about it, it does feel kind of cold and robotic to have her schedule time with me, but I feel like it's a really good solution. I'm not sure, AITA?My (20f) roommate (21f) “Amanda” has started to annoy me with some of her habits in the room. We both share a room. The beds are roughly 10 ft apart, if that, and there are two overhead lights and a vanity light.

In a previous post, I asked AITA for taking my meds around 12-1 am. That might provide some additional background information.

Last night, I had gotten into bed to sleep around 12:30 am, which is pretty normal for us. She had just gotten out of a FT call (that was on speaker the entire hour or so) with her family back at home, and was clearly not ready to sleep yet. This usually would not bother me had it not been that two nights prior, she had complained about me staying up an hour later than usual and brought up our roommate contract.

Anyways, I tried to sleep by turning away from the light and closing my eyes, but the overhead lights are super bright. I ended up texting my boyfriend for about half an hour before trying again. Sometime in that 30 minutes, she asked me if the guy she likes, Kevin, could spend the night. I told her it was okay because she had previously let my boyfriend stay over when he was visiting me for Valentines weekend. I was under the impression Kevin was going to come in the room within the hour and they would both go to sleep soon.

Amanda left the room, with her overhead light on, sometime from 1-2 am. She came back with Kevin at 3 am and didn’t turn off the light until 3:30 am. I didn’t get up to turn off the light myself in the first place because 1) I can normally sleep through it if I turn away from it and 2) I figured they would be in the room shortly after she left.

Another thing I can think of currently that I’m annoyed about is her not turning the power strip back on when she’s using the microwave. The microwave and mini fridge are connected to the same surge protector, so when the microwave is being used, it often causes the switch to flip off for a bit. Every time she causes it to switch off, she never turns it back on and she leaves the microwave door open. I’ve shown it to her three times now (most recently last night) how simple it is to turn it back on and explained (again) why it’s important to. She seemed apologetic and hopefully she’s got it this time.

There are other things that annoy me but cannot put in here without the bot flagging it down. It’s not super essential to put in here.

I’m worried that the reason why I want to confront her is because of how she acted in regards to my meds, but it’s also been bothering me genuinely.

So Reddit, WIBTA to confront her about some of the things that have bothered me?I recently got married, but this debacle is still bothering me. On its face, I would probably be considered TA, but hear me out:

1. My guest list for the wedding included a group of my childhood friends and we've all known each other since we were 10 years old (we're now in our 30s).
2. Before sending invitations, I emailed the group saying I couldn't give anyone a plus one yet because the venue had a strict headcount and they provided the chairs, so it was hard to ignore the limit. But I also said that, as people start to decline, I'll be happy to backfill with their boos/friends. I even said that, statistically, about 1/3 of wedding invitations are declined, so odds were good.
3. They say it's fine. I repeat: They said it was fine and they totally understand.
4. I send the invitations.
5. One friend, "Jane," then texts me saying our other friend, "Sandra," is mad her boyfriend wasn't invited. At first, I'm pissed because I got her blessing, but I calm down and call Sandra. I get her voicemail and leave one. She never calls back, but keeps communicating to me through Jane saying how disrespected she feels. Sandra lives about a 26-hour (one-way) drive from me, so it wasn't like I could go make her talk to me.
6. I tell Jane it isn't worth all this, so Sandra can bring her dude and we'll just figure out getting an extra chair to the venue for him. (The part about figuring out the extra chair was just to Jane. Jane was a bridesmaid, so it was a task I delegated to her, not a pointed statement to Sandra). She says she'll let her know, but not even a day later...
7. ...we get our first RSVP to decline. To put into context, the invitations were sent less than a week earlier. They were digital RSVPs, which is how it happened so quickly. I call Sandra, who doesn't answer again and doesn't call back. I call Jane to tell Sandra that her boo is officially invited.
8. Sandra declines his invitation because, and this is where I want to flip an effing table, she is the only person in this group of friends who is even in a relationship and she didn't want to "make the others feel bad for being single."

EDITED TO REWORD: In case you are wondering, all non-married/non-committed plus ones were on a case-by-case basis. Those were either because they'd know literally no one else there or because we knew their S.O.

Twist: Jane shares that Sandra is also mad because she wasn't a bridesmaid and feels like the only reason is because she's intermittently slept with my brother on multiple occasions across several relationships. I don't know if they have again during her current relationship, but they've cheated on their S.O.'s with each other in the recent past. I don't deny it because, yeah, it's very weird they do that while they are both in other relationships, they always act super awkward around each other, and my brother was in the wedding party as Best Bro of Honor. No regrets on avoiding that mess, but still... AITA?

ETA: Sandra attended the wedding, she only declined her bf's invitation. They do not live together, they've been together less than a year, and none of us had met him yet. Jane was the only bridesmaid from that group of friends.I've not been fussing too much about Coronavirus. Definitely not panicking. I was just looking forward to holidaying away from all the news. We're due to go to Adeje Tenerife next Tuesday. On Monday this week, we heard that a hotel about a mile away from where we've booked is in quarantine because someone was diagnosed with the Coronavirus. There's a police cordon around it. Another person has since been diagnosed. We've saved for this holiday. It's quite an expense to us. We won't get anything back from travel insurance. So it's not a question of rebooking. My husband wants still to go and thinks the virus will be everywhere anyway... I agree that's the likely scenario, especially in big multicultural cities where we live.. But. I don't want to be in quarantine abroad:- struggle with language for food, hygiene and medical help etc. Be away from possible support of our loved ones. Give them more to worry about and be a long way away. My husband is really pushing me to go. I think he'll be resentful if we don't. Btw we are both in our 70s, but fairly fit. I also think the advice about staying 1 or 2 metres away from other people will be rather hard to follow in airport queues etc.  What should I do? Possible Holiday sun sea air forest walks and a happier husband? Or city, traffic, freezing, grey and resentful husband?  

Background: My husband and I have been fostering children for the past 5 years. Together, we have 2 biological children as well (8 and 10). Our current placement is 12 years old and we’ll call her Daisy for the purpose of this post.

With foster care, at least in our area, you still have to get permission from the child’s parents before you take them out of state. We’ve had Daisy with us for nearly 10 months and have a decent relationship with her parents. In my opinion, it’s the best it can be given the situation.

My SIL (husband’s sister) is getting married in May. She lives in a different state and the wedding will be held there. She invited all of us, including Daisy, to come to the wedding. We put in a proper request through our state, however Daisy’s parents did not approve the request. There is a chance the judge could override it, but because they are normally compliant and have good points as to why they don’t want her to go, it probably won’t happen. I respect their thought process.

However, this would mean that Daisy would have to go in respite care during our week away. She’s had to go before and it wasn’t a good experience for her. She made it clear she never wants to go back unless it’s 100% necessary. This child has been through a lot. After much talk, my husband and I decided that he would take our biological children to the wedding, but if the courts decided to back up the parents’ choice, I would stay home with Daisy. Daisy is fine with this arrangement (though she wishes she could go).

SIL, however, is upset. She thinks that if Daisy cannot come, we should put her in respite care so I can be there. My SIL and I are close, but I feel that I need to put the needs of the child fist. SIL says that if I don’t go, she’s going to be devastated. My husband doesn’t want Daisy to go to respite care, but feels bad his sister is so hurt. I said while it sucks, Daisy is a priority. My husband agrees that she is, but my SIL will clearly resent me if I don’t go. My MIL has also chimed in saying that it’s a family event and we should all be there. Normally they’re super supportive of our fostering choices, but now they are not.

AITA for refusing to go if Daisy cannot?

Eta: Apparently I wasn’t clear. SIL didn’t bring it up and drop it. She and MIL continue to bring it up. And I explained why Daisy hates respite.**TLDR**: my brother isn't traveling to come to my wedding when he could if he tried at all.

I wanted my brother's wedding to be perfect so **I wore the bubblegum pink dress** and dyed-to-match David's Bridal shoes that his 18-year-old bride chose for her bridesmaids.

So when his best man couldn't afford to attend, I fundraised so he could. I asked my brother how much his friend needed. It was $250, and my friends gave it, $10 here and there. Bless them. I sent the money to him... but the best man did not attend.

When my brother was late for pictures, I stealthily excused myself to call him and talk him out of continuing to circle around the venue - he didn't have his best man with him, nor any of his groomsmen - so **I talked him out of his nerves**, convinced him to park his vehicle and come in. My SIL does not know this, to this day.

While his best man didn't come, I did, however, see my ex. My brother had invited the worst person I'd ever dated, the one who'd cheated on me repeatedly, was emotionally abusive, and owed me $13,000. Nice to be required to see him and his new girlfriend.

Fast forward ten years later. I'm getting married to someone from another country, and my brother says it's too expensive to come because they're going on an **Alaskan cruise**\* this year for their honeymoon. That he is getting paid $6,000 less this year, didn't get insurance for his wife so now they're stuck with her $3,000 medical bill, and they're broke\*\*. That he hasn't spent money on "anything this year except survival." That he hasn't even been doing his hobbies this year, like **building or flying airplanes**, no **golf**, nothing.  "It’s been kinda rough."

\*They've been paying slowly over 3 years so kudos to them for saving up. However, considering the fears around going on a cruise ship in the midst of the Coronavirus outbreak, I suggested that they inquire about delaying until more is understood about the dangers. Easy excuse to be able to afford to come to his sister's (fall) wedding (that he's known about since last fall). But he won't ask.

\*\*My dad would've definitely loaned him the travel money *if* he'd asked. My dad also said that he actually got a $1,000 raise, but just didn't perform as well as he should have in sales. 

**AITA for hoping he and his self-absorbed wife get quarantined** (but not sick; I'm not a monster) **on a Coronavirus Cruise ship and have a horrible time?**

*My real, underlying concern, if you're wondering, is this: my SIL has isolated my brother from our mother; he's thinking about quitting working for my dad (who has handed bro the business he built) to go work* somewhere else *in the same industry; and even after flying home multiple times yearly and trying to arrange get-togethers, she often "wins" and they don't come, or do, and leave early.*

 *I miss my brother and I'm starting to really resent my SIL. (But I do realize he is his own person here too).*My husband (36) and I (34) have always know we wanted children and we have been trying for the last year without success. Were both feeling a bit sad that it's not going so well but there's still options to explore. 

In that time within my friendship group one friend I'm not particularly close to who freely admitted she didn't really want children has had a baby and now her entire Instagram is just photos of the baby and talking about her "mummy friends". 

Now the two friends I am closed to in the group have both announced they are pregnant (about two weeks apart). They are already planning all the things they are going to do on maternity leave together. I know they are not trying to exclude me, they keep talking about how I'm going to be the 'fun aunt' and have said to call them out if they get as bad as friend No.1

But I am inexplicably furious - stemming from jealousy I guess. I feel like a complete cow for feeling like this towards two people I care deeply about and really can't face telling them how I feel. I'm also worried that I'm going to lose control of my emotions and verbally lash out. For now I've just been saying how happy/excited I am for them both. (Which is true, it's just all mixed in with the jealousy.)

So WIBTA if I took a bit of time out (maybe just a couple of weeks) from this group by just saying I'm a bit snowed under with work and without explaining the real reason until I'm feeling a bit more together?Bit rambling...had to cut...Timeline is my best approximation. Names have been changed and ages are current. Location is Ontario (Canada). My (37F) brother Tony (33M) met Angie (31F) about 5 ½ years ago and they began a whirlwind romance. She had a daughter (Olivia) as a teen and raising her as a single mother Olivia has no relationship w her father. Olivia is a bright, kind girl and I care deeply for her.  Well, less than 6 months into Tony and Angie’s romance they’re announce they’re expecting a baby. Shortly after, they move into my brother’s house. Olivia was around 9 at the time, and she started calling my brother “dad” strange but my brother seemed to like it. However, less than 2 months of living together they broke up and Angie and Olivia moved out and there was relative peace until the baby Elizabeth was born. Fast-forward to a year or so after, we start to notice she’s not hitting milestones. Late in 2019 blood tests confirm a rare genetic condition (presents similar to Autism spectrum) and she will be developmentally delayed her whole life, and it is unlikely she will speak much if at all.  Meanwhile, all this stress completely deteriorated what was left of peace between Tony and Angie.  Tony’s moved on with his life and started another relationship.
Meanwhile, Angie gets a lawyer and goes after my brother for of child support for both kids bc he was “father figure”. My bro asked family not to engage lest we mess up the legal battle. Got a call last week to let me know the legal battle had been settled. (details unknown) “My reply was “this is great it’s finally over and we can see Olivia!“ THAT DID NOT go over well. Since then novel-length nasty texts from my brother and SIL suggesting it’s deplorable I would be friendly after what a nightmare they put him through. They made it no secret that if I want a relationship with Olivia (who is a CHILD  and the half-sister and to my disabled niece) they consider it a betrayal and will distance themselves from me. My alliance generally is with my brother but this reaction seems extreme and not normal. Also….I’m starting to have concerns about WHY they’re so angry at me? 
AITA for not siding w my brother??

Edit 1 - my original piece was too long so I cut out information that seems to be relevant. Before the lawsuit my brother knowingly payed less child support than he should of bc he thought he thought she’d never get a lawyer. He actually said to me he was doing this “maintain his lifestyle”. He’s really mad now bc he owes more monthly and the backdated difference. Bro was warned many times this could backfire but he’s pretty stubborn isn’t much for taking advice.

Edit 2 - Olivia has been in my life continually since I met her. She and Elizabeth came together for weekend visits for a few years (still calling him dad until last summer). Then my brother sent her mom a text message (encouraged  by his new girlfriend) saying “he can’t afford to take Olivia too and please tell her to stop calling me dad”. Olivia saw these messages and was crushed. The appalling way Olivia was caught in the middle of this has always bothered me. If this happened to me at her age, it would have destroyed me.


Edit 3: talked to a friend who’s a family lawyer - there is zero interest by the courts financially punish stepfathers for caring about step children. Her lawyer is known well for being smart and agressive;  more than likely used this meaningless threat as a scare tactic to close out her towering public defender files. (That part was thrown out of course)

Edit 4: I’m gonna come clear about my second motive - I love Olivia and want to reconnect but don’t really want to be friends with Angie. BUT I would like to have some ability to see how my vulnerable non verbal bio-niece lives, the people she’s exposed to etc.  

I have a friend we’ll call Grace. Grace is a lesbian, she’s been out since before I met her. I’m supportive of this. 

Because I live in a different state from my parents, Grace has only ever met them a couple of times. During these times, she was single. However, I’m getting married and now, Grace has a girlfriend, which is awesome. Her girlfriend is out of state the weekend of the wedding or else she would attend. Grace is a bridesmaid, by the way.

Here’s the issue at hand. My mom is homophobic. My dad could care less, but my mom is very religious and has a lot of views I do not personally agree with. However, I know if Grace brings up her girlfriend around her, my mom will make a comment. It’s just in her nature. If Grace’s girlfriend was attending the wedding, I would find a way to deal with my mom and make sure she laid off the two. 

However, I don’t think it’s worth the fuss since Grace will be attending the wedding alone. I told Grace not to hide who she is, but warned her how my mom is. Grace said “I’m not going to curb talking about my girlfriend for your mom’s comfort. (Insert our other friend’s name/maid of honor) will probably talk about her fiancé, you get to talk about yours. I’m not going to stay quiet because your mom is homophobic.”

I understood but told her that she’d have to deal with however my mom reacted. I said I’d defend her, but it might bring her more comfort to just not talk about her girlfriend in front of my mom. I don’t want drama at my wedding. Ever since this discussion, it’s been radio silence from Grace and the wedding is next weekend. The only thing she responded to was if I asked if she was still in the wedding and she said “Of course, I made a commitment to you.”

I told our other friend/my MOH and she was horrified. She said that I definitely should tell my mom to control how she talks and not the other way around. I’m starting to feel really guilty. 

Am I being an ass here?I just took a flight with my family (me, husband, 11 year old) and we booked three seats close together, but weren’t given the option to select who got what seat when we booked. 

My 11 year old got the single seat, so when we boarded the plane, we agreed my husband would take the single seat and I’d go and sit with our kid. (e.g., my husband I were originally assigned seats 12 A and B, and my kid was assigned seat 13 A. My husband was going to move to the single seat.) 

When we boarded the flight, the flight attendant checked everyone’s boarding passes as they got on, and came over when she noticed we’d changed seats. 

She said we had to sit in our assigned seats and I said we were assigned all these seats, they all belonged to us, we were just reordering which of us sat where to accommodate my child. 

She said it was a security concern and everyone had to sit in the seat number they were assigned. I wasn’t about to have my 11 year old sitting alone for 7 hours, if anything because the person next to them would quickly get annoyed with how often they got up to come and talk to me and vice versa. 

The flight attendant insisted, so I decided we’d just sit in the seats until takeoff, since that’s usually the important time on a flight and I didn’t want to hold up everyone else, then switch. 

Take off comes and goes, we’re at cruising altitude, we switch. 

The flight attendant notices we’ve switched and tells us to switch back. I tell her it’s not happening and unless they’re emergency landing the plane and dropping us back off at the airport, this is where we’re sitting. 

At the time I thought I was in the right, but one of the people caught between us in the altercation made a comment along the lines of “She’s just doing her job.” And “You need to follow security protocols even if it’s not convenient for you.” 

I’m seriously rethinking the whole interaction now and wondering, AITA?My friend's husband just passed away suddenly due to some health problems that complicated and worsen over a short period. It was quite a shock as he was young(24), had been in rather good form, and they have only just got married last year.


She asked me out to talk about it, as I have the same health problems as her husband and we could probably relate. She is also a close friend of mine as we grew up together, so I suppose I was her best choice at the moment.


My friend was in a mess, she started weeping as soon as she saw me and it breaks my heart to see her in that state. She started talking about her husband's life, how they met, how she was aware of his conditions and still went on with it, how she looked out for him, and how much of a future they planned together.


As I heard more about her husband, it actually occurred to me that it could also be me. I look very healthy too, and I have dreams of my own that are yet to be achieved. I begin to worry what happens if I die suddenly like he did? It is totally possible, in fact, even common. Everything I wanted to do, my hopes and dreams, people I care for, would they all come crashing down like my friend? 


I started to tell my friend about my fears and worries, sharing how it scares me that I could probably just be gone one day without knowing. My friend then became angry and said that I was making this all about myself when she came to me to find comfort while grieving.


We managed to make up before going separate ways but I was wondering AITA? I think I should not have said those but it was making me uncomfortable and I felt I needed to talk too at that moment.A friend of mine will be away for a year or so, and my group of friends are thinking of sending him off at the airport. I am close to him as we used to spend a lot of time in school together. But I am not keen on sending him off because I do not see a reason to. He will be back after a year anyway, it's not like he will be gone forever. Also, the airport is two hours away from where I live so it would be a total commute of four hours for me. I would prefer to spend the time otherwise, like hanging out with another group of friends. For the record, I have never sent anyone off at the airport (except one who migrated for good).

Another thing, I have rejected the idea by my group of friends to purchase him farewell gifts (I told them that if they wanted to, they can do it without me). That issue seemed to have made them angry that I was not interested in doing more for my friend departing.

That being said, WIBTA if I do not send my friend off at the airport?My mom is throwing me and my fiancé an engagement party this summer. It will be at our summer home that is super small but does have 3 bedrooms, it’s my parents house but we often visit them there.

My siblings will be there as well, so between my fiancé and I, my three siblings, and my parents, we already have people sleeping out on the couch. 

I invited my 3 best friends from college who are all seriously dating someone, so I invited their boyfriends as well. I went to school on the opposite coast, so they would have to fly here. I’m not by any means expecting them to come as that’s a lot of money and work, but I’d of course love if they did!

They asked if they could stay at my house. I told them that I don’t live near the summer house and we’re all staying there and unfortunately there isn’t enough room. They did not seem happy and said they’ll have to get back to me. 

Should I rent out another house nearby for them to stay in? Or rent it out and stay there and split costs with them? I was kind of expecting them to either not come or figure out their own accommodations (I have plenty of other friend groups coming as well as family so I can’t find situations for everyone, although they would be flying the furthest out of anyone. AITA if I don’t either make room for them to stay at the house or find a place for them to stay?I (25F) have been seeing a therapist for a little less than a month after postponing this for years, since I was always moving from city to city before and I've only now managed to settle down for a few months.
Anyways, yesterday I had an extremely upsetting encounter with a guy on Twitter. He had DMd me a few months back to compliment me on my work (we are both writers) out of nowhere, I had replied thanking him for the compliment and never answered after that. He has been having this monologue in my DMs for months now about how amazing and sexy and fantastic and uninhibited I am despite not knowing me at all and only getting a sense of who I am from my social media (which I keep professional exactly to avoid this kind of attention, even if I think its bullshit that I have to self censor myself cause men can't keep it in their pants). I basically didn't read any of it attentively, but yesterday morning I caught a glimpse of the latest message that he (who, I repeat, is a potential colleague who I never interacted with and who is at least 15 years older than me) sent me and I was absolutely disgusted to read an incredibly lewd description of what he imagines I look like naked, with details of my daily life based on past tweets I'd written. I was very very upset by this and I couldn't focus on anything but this all day, which also disturbed my working performance, and I just felt so dehumanised and dirty. 
So evening comes and I go see my therapist, who I had planned an appointment with days prior. I opened with the story of this guy, telling my therapist  (a 60 year oldish man) that it was having a heavy impact of how I perceive myself. I was crying. And the guy just goes "Oh, it does sound like you're genuinely upset" and  then he just CHANGES THE TOPIC AND NEVER GETS BACK TO IT. I have issues with confronting people (something I was hoping to work on...in therapy...) so I wasn't able to get him back on this topic and it just made me feel like he thought it wasn't an important enough thing or that I was just being too sensitive or whatever.
Now I dread the idea of going back to him, but I have four other appointments with him planned for the next few weeks. Would I be the asshole if I dropped him for this? Is it a bullshit reason? Some of my friends told me they think so and I should just discuss it with the therapist and get over it.Hey, I'm Chris(38m) and I have a daughter (14f), Bailey. It's just us. Her mother died when she was 8. I'm still coping from it, and we're in a pretty financially rough place, which brings us to late summer in 2019, Bailey's 14th birthday party. 

The original plan for Bailey's birthday fell through (she wanted to see a concert with friends. Couldn't save up enough in time before they had sold out.)

Something Bailey has wanted to do for years is paint her walls Blue (we just moved into a house that's allowing us to make modifications like that) because Blue was her mom's favorite color. 

So, I started to make plans with her. We would have a party at our house. Pizza, Cake, maybe ice cream, some snacks, etc., I'd let them use my Xbox for whatever version of just dance my daughter owns, and the pièce de résistance would be the "paint balloon fight" in Bailey's room. 

I would tape off and cover the floor, ceiling, windows, basically everything that didn't need paint on it. I would have the kids change into scrap clothes and I would let them essentially have a water balloon fight, but with paint instead of water. (That's the best way to explain it, although the point was to get paint on the walls. It was messy though.)

(I'm aware that this is inefficient and wasteful as hell. I chipped in on some of the paint, Bailey's grandparents helped pay for a lot of it, and soon after the party they came by and painted the walls for real with us. This was just a way for my daughter to do something she wanted with her friends.) 

I TOLD EVERY CHILD AND EVERY CHILD'S PARENT THAT THIS WAS HAPPENING REPEATEDLY. EVERYONE INVITED WAS FOREWARNED THAT THIS WAS HAPPENING. 

But here's the conflict; Emma. Emma showed up in a flowery, light pink dress. I reminded her and her mom of the plan. Emma seemed excited about it, Emma's mom sort of just.. shrugged me off, I guess? And left. Well, party goes smooth, the kids migrate to Bailey's room with their balloons, and I notice Emma is still in her dress. I went up to her and I offered her some of Bailey's scrap clothes and she took them and changed. We did the walls, the kids had fun, we ate cake, parents came to get their kids, all was well. 

And then Emma's mom showed up. She saw Emma, splattered with paint, and freaked. Out. She screamed at her Emma for participating, she screamed at me for letting Emma participate and "ruining her pretty dress" (The dress was perfectly intact. I didn't know Emma wasn't allowed to participate.) And she screamed at Bailey for not having a normal party. 

I was pissed, but I thanked Emma for coming, gave her a piece of cake to take home, gave her mother the INTACT dress, and they left. 

I was talking to my friends about this recently and they were pretty split. Some of them said I was an asshole for not realizing that Emma wasn't allowed to join in. Others said I wasn't an asshole and that Emma's mom freaked out way too much. 
So.. AITA?

Edit: I had sent out a few emails and several text messages to all the parents involved. The initial message went like this (more or less, cutting out a few details for privacy)
"Hi, 
It's me, Chris, Bailey's father. I'd just like you all to know that Bailey is having a birthday party on {Date} at our house in {place} starting at 3. There will be food/drinks. I'm planning to do a very messy project in Bailey's room- we want to paint the walls in a fun way. I believe the plan is to fill up some water balloons with some paint and Chuck them at the walls of Bailey's room. The intention is to paint the walls, so the paint may not come out of hair/clothes that easy, so I would have your kid wear or bring scrappy clothes if they want to take part in it. It's fine if you don't want to let your kid participate, I don't plan to force anyone. Just let me know!"My brother is getting married in a small ceremony with family and close friends only. I have two kids (ages 15 and 12) who I have 50/50 custody of. Their Dad can be difficult when trying to change the schedule. My brother planned the wedding on a weekend I don't have my kids. Not on purpose, he just decided that was best for him. It is at my other brother's house, so there is no having to reserve a place or other complications.

AITA for not wanting to go to his wedding?

Edit: ready to admit my wrong, but found out he checked with all other immediate family members that they were available before setting the date, including other children younger than mine (they do plays so wanted to make sure didn’t conflict)

Edit2: thank you for the continuing comments. Having revelations about my feelings toward my brother and his fiance.Hi Reddit, throwaway account and posting on mobile so bear with me please.

My husband and I go to the local WaffleHouse about twice a month and know most of the waitresses and cooks. In the past (and still as far as i know) we have had a good rapport with all of them. I almost always tip 40% or more as I know that we can afford it and we always get excellent service.

Recently however WaffleHouse hired a new waitress who clearly has a mental disability. Now this doesn't bother us so we have no problem with her taking our order. However the problem began when she started telling my husband that he was "very good looking" and asking him "can you take me on a date?". To be honest it didn't really bother me the first few times she said it but she just wouldn't let it go.  When it was time to get out glasses refilled she refilled his but shot me a dirty look when I asked her for a refill as well.  This kind of behavior went on through out the course of the meal. 

When the meal was over and my husband asked me how much to tip in a $32.44 ticket I told him to leave the change so .56 cents. He didn't say anything at the time but later when we got home he told me that it bothered him that I didn't tip her well, and that she only acted that way because of her disability. My argument is if she can work there than she can do so without harassing clients. So AITA?Title is pretty self explanatory but additional detail:

My parents were married for years, divorced when I was 16, I'm currently 19, dad has since remarried. I have another full sibling, a brother, age 22. Dad invited us both out to dinner. We were there maybe 10 minutes, sat down, ordered drinks, and dad said he didn't want to order food yet because we were waiting for someone. We waited, and a woman showed up. Dad introduced her as our sister. My half sister was born about 6 months after me, meaning dad cheated on mum while they were married/my brother was a toddler/she was pregnant with me. I asked if we had any more siblings we didn't know about. Dad said "I don't want to discuss that right now", which is code for "yup but you look mad right now". I left without a word. My brother and "sister" tried to follow me and get me to come back. I kept walking. My brother has since texted me saying I acted like a bitch and shouldn't have stormed out, I really upset our "sister" and dad spent the whole night calling me a brat. \[edit: dad was the one calling me a brat, not our sister\]

AITA for storming out? Because I don't feel like I am but if my brother, who I'm actually close with, thinks I was a bitch about it then that's not a good sign.

Info: Just to clarify I'm a woman.So Ill be telling this on behalf of my friend who Ill call Z. This story happened some time ago so bear with me

I'm a 20m who until recently lived at home while I went to school. I have a brother who is three years younger than me. My brother who Ill just call A has downs syndrome. 

For as long as I can remember Ive taken care of my brother. He has always come first and I put up with it. I was originally going to go to my local community college but I ended up getting several scholarships to a much better school a few countys over. I would be about 2 hours away from my family. I would live in dorms. I would start up this coming fall, (this was last fall 2019) 

I was excited and told my parents who werent as happy for me as I thought they'd be. They told me that it wouldnt work as they'd need me close by to help with my brother as he soon wont be in the public school system.

I told them I didnt want to pass up this opportunity but they persisted that family comes before everything. In our arguement it came to light they believed I would take up primary care of my brother as they advanced in age. 

I. HAVE. NEVER. AGREED. TO. THIS. If I'm being honest I thought he would get put in a program or a group home. He is by no means high functioning and he requires a lot of support. I lost it amd told them I wouldnt give up any more of my life because of him. 

I have never had friends over becaise of him, I couldnt bring girls home because he would openly touch himself while my parents would just try to shush him if he made noises. I told them I was going and it was up to them what they did with my brother in the future but I would never be his primary care giver. 

They threw me out for not accepting my brother but I dont feel like I have to give up my life for a child i didnt make that will consume my life. 
AITA?

Again this is on behalf of a friend who doesnt have an account he would like a little unbiased feed back

Edit: Z is in college and his brother turned 18 a month ago. As soon as this school year is done they will probably have to hire outside help but theyve looked into a company called inclusion but he may not be high functioning enough for their services. His aggression has also upped quite a bit so only time will tell. Z is out living his best life though solid 3.9 gpa

Edit: Zs brother's anger issues and a recent act of violence are what is pulling him out of the public schooling system. I'm aware he should be supported until 21 but the problem is large enough that criminal charges were considered. However as he is mentally incapable of standing trial they're trying to do something that would better support himQuick background, my ex/child’s father (referred to as Fred) was in my life from 2006-2010. We dated and had our son in 2009, breaking up the next year. He was still very active in his life and he saw him every weekend. We had a decent co-parenting relationship. In 2011 he met his now wife and they were pregnant very quickly with their first child. Around 2013 we stopped hearing from them completely, I moved two hours away for work (we live in a very rural state and the town we all lived in had zero job opportunities). I offered different ways for him to remain involved but communication on his end ceased completely after the move. I no longer send updates as he never responded to any for years. He continues to pay child support via paycheck deductions but he has made zero effort to see my son in nearly seven years.

 

Two weeks ago, his wife friend requested me on Facebook. I noticed that they have since had three more children since our last contact and that they still live in the same town two hours away. She is very much the small town American social media obsessed type mom. Yesterday she posted something about her complete family as it was some anniversary, she has all girls with my ex and her child from a previous relationship was also a girl. Her status mentioned how “no boys are necessary to complete our famILY*" and my heart broke for my son. There were lots of comments about how happy this family is and how “perfect” they all are. How great of a person she and Fred are.  She responded to a comment about how hard it must be for Fred to have all girls that “he wouldn’t have it any other way! he is the best daddy ever!”

 

I got very angry. I left the following comment: “Did everyone forget about Fred’s son? The one that he all but abandoned seven years ago because his son moved two hours away? The son he never responds to texts/emails about? The son that he has his name tattooed on his arm for the world to see? The son that asks about his sister (apparently sisters now) and Fred regularly? Let’s not pretend that this man is some amazing father, he is a deadbeat.”

There were a lot of confused comments and even people who had no idea Fred had a son. Eventually she deleted my comment. 

 

She messaged me and tore me apart before blocking me completely. In her message she told me that her and Fred are not responsible for the fact that I moved two hours away and that’s just very far for them so it was hard to make it work. They both were and are gainfully employed with cars and licenses.

I told my sister and a good friend about this, my sister believes this was a very YTA move on my part but my friend thinks that they deserved it, especially since she sought me out.

Am I the asshole for confronting her on her FB? About 12 years ago, a friend of mine decided to get a tattoo that he had wanted: a small Kanji that was supposed to mean a particular word.

I was studying Japanese and when he showed off the tattoo, I knew immediately that it wasn't the typical symbol and asked whether he went with a more obscure one which might not mean the word he intended. It turns out he did not do any research and had just gone to the tattoo parlor without even a drawing of what he wanted.

I pulled out my books and insisted that we look it up immediately. It took a while, but it turned out that the character he had proudly been showing off actually declared him to be the 'woman in a gay relationship'. He immediately went back to the parlor with my book and something covering the tattoo to get it covered up.

A week later, I happened upon a shirt with the phrase, "Your tattoo really means 'eggroll' in Chinese." I thought it was hysterical and bought it then wore it the next time I was around that friend. He took it in stride, even seemed to find the humor in it as well.

Yesterday, I unearthed that shirt again and wore it while doing some housework then to go grab dinner. I ran into that friend and his wife. He took one look at the shirt, began laughing, and told his wife about the story of the shirt. She was not amused and said several things about it being insensitive and nasty.

I didn't intend to run into my friend and haven't worn the shirt in front of him with the exception of right after I bought it and when he finally had the entire tattoo removed. AITA?

Edit 1: I am female, my friend is male.
I own a small business in this small shop. This shop has a small apartment on top where I live. I was still open late last night when all the other stores nearby were closed. A woman came in asking to use my restroom. I told her we didn’t have public restrooms.

This is in an old part of town where all the storefronts dont have restrooms. Just bathrooms in the upstairs apartments that they don’t have access to. One of the stores built bathrooms behind them and for a fee will let the neighboring businesses have access to them. 

I didn’t see the point in paying the fee to get access to them because my business doesn’t have any employees and isn’t required to have an employee restroom.  

She said she had a medical condition and needed to use the employee restroom. 

When I said I didn’t have one she said I was required to have one (I’m not) and let her use it. So where was my restroom.

I told her how I don’t have any employees. She looked upset and asked where I went. 

I said I live in the apartment upstairs, but she can’t use my private toilet.

I didn’t want a stranger in my private residence. Especially since it was late at night an no one else was around. The whole idea made me uneasy.

I told her where the closest gas station was. It was admittedly kind of far though because I knew no one else in the area would be open.

She left after asking what was the matter with me and that she was going to report me.Relevant BG: My brother (David) is my step brother and lived in Europe for about 10 years. He has one kid (15 f, Martha) He married a woman (Donna) with 2 children about 5 years ago. Kids are currently 16 (Rose) and 9 (Jack) He moved back to our hometown in Ontario in January. They are staying in my house until their house closes at the end of March. Donna has been cold and standoffish the whole time and I chalked it up to cultural issues or homesickness from the move. Nope, she hates me and most of our family.


Last weekend was Rose's birthday and we had a small family party for her. A few days later, Rose asked me why I gave her a present. I explained to her that I usually give cash to the older kids, but since this was my first opportunity to buy her a physical present I decided to do that. Then she asked why we had suddenly decided to acknowledge her birthday at all, since we haven't in the past. 


I've been sending Rose, Jack and Martha birthday/Christmas money every year. I send an Etransfer to my brothers Canadian bank account and he gives it to the kids. Rose tells me that her and Jack have never received anything from any person in our family, only Martha has. I told her there must have been a mistake and I would look into it.

Rose must have said something to Donna because she came and asked me about it. I showed her the proof that I had sent money for all 3 kids at Christmas, as well as Jack's Birthday in the summer, and offered to show her my bank account, email confirmation and facebook messages to bro, I would just need time to go through my records and email account. She said no.


Turns out, Martha was jealous that our family accepted Rose and Jack as family and instead of parenting her, David was just pocketing the money that wasn't for Martha and saying nothing about it. Donna and David argued for hours about it. Donna eventually came and apologized for thinking the worst of us and took her kids to a hotel. I kicked David out for being a lying POS thief.


Now our family is divided, half think I'm an asshole and shouldn't have said anything and the other half want to cut him out for stealing from us.

So Am I the asshole? Should I have just kept quiet and not said anything?So I'm playing poker with a few friends last night. Most of them are dads. We're all in our 30s.

This friend of mine has a 3 month old. He's a weird guy in general (I've known him forever, he's never been giving; ie, tipping 5% when we go out, asking to split the check with his girlfriends on their birthdays, etc). I should also say that he is semi-employed, sets his own hours, and works from home. Anyway, I ask him how fatherhood is treating him, and he said great.

I said, isn't it hard to get sleep with a newborn? And he said "my wife deals with night time. I sleep through the night." Another friend asked him what that meant -- he said "I need to sleep because I have work." And I said "but don't most dads help out at night?" and he said "I can't. I need to be rested for work" -- at this point, all the dads --- who have full time jobs, unlike my friend -- are laughing and saying things like "yeah, so do I. But I'm not sleeping!"

So I say "but isn't your wife kind of working all the time herself?" and he again says "I have to work in the morning" and I just break out laughing. Like I can't stop. He looks at me like "WTF" and I say "dude, you can't help your wife at night? Like change a diaper?" and then he seemed to get mad and said "I have to sleep to be ready to work in the morning!"

Anyway, am I the asshole for laughing at him? His wife is a little meek, so she'd definitely never say anything to him, but I'm kind of glad we all made fun of him for not helping his wife at night?

EDIT: they don't have an arrangement where he helps out during the dayMy roommate (21 F) and I (21 F) are university students and live in a dorm on campus. I’ll call her Jane. 

Jane recently had her birthday, and she turned 21, so it was a big one. Because of our schedules we don’t see each other a ton, as I go to bed early (10pm ish) and wake up early (5:30am - 6:30am), and she goes to bed late (12am - 1am) and wakes up late (9am - 10am). This hasn’t been a problem in the past, we’re both good at being quiet and using lamps instead of overhead lights when someone else is sleeping. 

Anyways, Jane’s birthday was on a Tuesday, so we had classes. I woke up early as usual and left a present and card on her desk, knowing that I probably wouldn’t see her at all that day because of our different schedules. I texted her happy birthday during the day too and made sure she was having a good day. 

After classes and work I got to the room at about 8pm. The room was empty so I assumed Jane was out at bars or something with her friends (Jane and I are not really friends so I wasn’t offended that I wasn’t invited. Even if she had invited me I would’ve had to say no because of my work shift). I was dead tired and knew I would have to wake up early the next day, so I immediately got ready for bed and fell asleep around 8:30pm.

Around 9pm, I was shaken awake. In my groggy state I suddenly recognized Jane and like four strangers behind her, all watching me sleep. I (not so nicely) asked her what the hell was going on, she said something along the lines of “You have to leave, no one is asleep by 9pm, it’s my birthday, we need to drink in here.” I told her that there are many places—such as bars—for her and her friends to hang out, but that this was literally the only place I could sleep. Jane replies “Yeah, but we’re going to bars later, not now.” I suggested any of the four lounges in our building, she said they couldn’t because they’re not allowed to drink in public. I suggested one of her other friends’ rooms, she said that she preferred ours because it was bigger. 

Eventually I grumpily said “I don’t know what to tell you, I need to sleep” and promptly turned over to sleep. I heard her grumbling to her friends but eventually she turned off the light and left and I fell back asleep immediately. 

When I woke up I thought about what had happened and felt guilty. Jane hadn’t warned me that she wanted to have a party with her friends on a Tuesday night in our dorm, but I also didn’t warn her I was going to sleep early. On the other hand, maybe I should’ve assumed she’d want the room because it was her birthday? I am not sure. Additionally, I don’t like Jane personally for other reasons (messiness, calling me ugly on occasion, making fun of my major/job, etc), so I am worried that my dislike for her clouded my judgement and I was not the nicest person I could’ve been. AITA?My cousin recently got married. He had a rehearsal dinner on the Friday, before tying the knot on Sunday. I was planning on attending the rehearsal dinner with my wife but then I got word that I had won two tickets to see Hamilton on the Friday evening.

Since the rehearsal dinner was not small, and since my cousin lives a few hours ago, my wife and I decided to see Hamilton, and then leave on early Saturday morning. That way we would get there with plenty of time to spare before the photos that were planned for the Saturday afternoon. We also made sure to let my cousin know ahead of time we wouldn’t be attending the dinner. He was fine with it.

On the Saturday night a couple of people asked me why we were absent the previous night. When I mentioned seeing Hamilton, my cousin’s family became furious. His parents (especially his mother) accused us of being disloyal to my family, and his now-wife was also really upset.

My wife thinks that maybe we did the wrong thing. I don’t, for five reasons:

01)It was Hamilton!

02)It was just a rehearsal dinner. We would never have missed the actual wedding, and we’re cousins. If it was my sibling, I would definitely have attended.

03)I suspect that one of the reasons why there was so much anger (especially from my cousin’s wife) is that they expected an extra gift. However our wedding gift wasn’t exactly cheap. I think it was more than sufficient, especially when we had already gotten them an engagement gift. (That could be me being overly cynical however his wife and family are pretty materialistic.)

04)My cousin was fine with it. In fact he even joked that he wishes we had gotten a third ticket for him.

05)It was Hamilton!

AITA?

EDIT: just to clear it up, I didn’t win tickets through a lottery. I won tickets through work, and it wasn’t specified when the show would be. The person running the competition didn’t even know, and I only found out when I got an email, containing the date, confirming I still wanted the prize. I then rang my cousin before confirming my interest.

EDIT: yeh, I shouldn’t have mentioned the extra gift. I agree, it’s not relevant and does come across as ahy.
So a couple weeks ago I was driving home. My neighbor was on an electric bike went way too fast down a hill and crashed into my car. He dented my car bad and broke through my windshield.

I wasn’t at fault as I was stopped at a stop sign and he ran through one right into me.

It was a really bad accident and the guy died. I injured my shoulder and broke my wrist and needed to have surgery to put some stabilizing screws put in.

This guy had a wife and kids that he supported. They’re having a hard time financially since he passed as he was the breadwinner and the wife hadn’t worked for years so she’s having trouble finding work. 

So would I be the asshole if I sued his estate to get my medical bills and my car paid for. I do need the money, but not nearly as desperately as they do.

Edit. On the advice of many people I will just file the claim with my insurance because it will be less messy than me getting the money from them personally. If my rates go up I will change my insurance provider.

Thanks all. I’m signing off now.I (27M) have three cats. My wife passed away on the 4th of this month, it was unexpected, I'm not okay, she was my best friend, I wish I could have been better for her, maybe she'd still be here. She loved cats so we adopted 3 of them. The youngest is still a kitten, the older two are adult cats. The oldest cat is standoffish and very unfriendly. She's not mean, she just prefers to be alone.

My wife died in our home, I found her body, the carpet in front of the bathroom in the master bedroom still has her blood on it, I couldn't stay there so I moved back in with my parents and sister. My sister immediately took to all three cats, and they took to her. The oldest cat especially likes my sister and my sister spends a great deal of time with her. We'll call the oldest cat "Tessa". The problem is, Tessa misses my wife and the fact that we're no longer in our apartment, and my wife is never coming back has taken a toll on Tessa. Tessa's just completely unhappy. She's sniping at everyone, she's walking around growling and snarling under her breath, she's bullying the other two cats. 

I don't blame Tessa, she's been through the same trauma that I've been through. The other cats weren't in the bedroom where my wife died. But it isn't fair for Tessa to be so unhappy. My wife's best friend "Mara" has been by to visit several times and every time she visits Tessa comes to life, a totally different cat, haven't seen her act so happy since my wife passed. Even with my sister Tessa doesn't get this eager and playful. Mara and I have discussed it and we both think it would be best if Tessa went to live with her. My sister (24F) got very upset and said that after all the trauma Tessa has gone through (my wife dying in front of her, the noise, being uprooted from our apartment, my wife never coming back) she needed to stay in one place. My sister insisted that she can love Tessa through this and make her happy again. She even offered to buy Tessa from me but my mind was made up, I need to do what's best for Tessa and I think Mara, who has always loved Tessa, would be the best.

Last night I packed up Tessa's toys and food and took her to Mara's house. Tessa ran across the room and threw herself into Mara's arms and immediately started purring. I haven't seen her that relaxed since the 4th. I told my sweet girl goodbye and that I'll come see her all the time. My sister was at work when I took Tessa to her new home and when she got home and my mom and I explained where Tessa had gone my sister hit her knees and started crying. Through her tears my sister said something to the effect of "sister-in-law is gone, everything is different, and now Tessa's gone. Everything's wrong." I knew my sister adored my wife but I didn't know her death had meant so much, but I guess it would have, my wife and sister were born four months apart.

AITA for rehoming my cat and not letting my sister say goodbye?So my Nan passed last year and her belongings got left to me. One of the things I kept of hers was an iPad I had bought her before she passed.

I recently left the iPad at my girlfriend's house for a few days and when I came back over the whole front screen was shattered. This made me irrationally upset because of the sentimental value attached to it. My girlfriend said she had it in her bag at one point but doesnt know how it got broken, took no responsibility for it at all which sorta bugged me but shit happens.

Turned it on and it's not working. I said to gf "I hope you would offer to atleast go halves in fixing it" and she completely blew up at me. She said how dare I try and scrounge money out of her, she would never ask me to pay in that situation, it's disgusting I'd even ask etc.

I let it go and got over it soon after because it is only an iPad, but would like to know if other people agree I was out of line for wanting her to contribute?So this has been bothering me since before Christmas and I want to finally know if I was the AH here or not. 

My boyfriend and I have been dating for 3 years and we are both 24. His ex gf is 24 as well and they dated for 5 years and broke up when she cheated on him. 

We were out Christmas shopping for his family and as we were perusing through this one store, some girl comes up to him that works there and says “hey your ex wants to talk to you, she works here”. Before I could register what was happening he replied “oh awesome ok where is she” and starts walking off with this random girl and leaving me there with all the bags. 

I followed him and said “hey can we please just keep shopping, we’ve been here for hours and I want to get home soon...I’m not really comfortable with you talking to your ex...” 

The reason why I’m not comfortable with her is because on multiple occasions she has tried wiggling back into his life sexually and it has driven a bit of a wedge between us. 

He immediately got furious at me and started not so subtly telling me off for controlling him in the middle of this very public department store and I started tearing up. He said I was being a f*ng child and stormed off to go talk to her. I sat there on one of the chairs and waited for 40 minutes while he was laughing and chatting with her. A few people came up to me and asked me if I was okay so I was pretty embarrassed. 

At the 45 minute mark I decided to just leave. I dropped the bags off behind him and he didn’t even notice or turn around even though she saw me. I stood there for a minute to see if he’d notice me then said “hey bf, can I cut in for a second?” And he shushed me. 

I walked out and went home. He blew up my phone about 15 minutes after I got home, so approx 1 hour after I left and said I was the most immature, controlling person he’s ever met and I should be ashamed of my behaviour. 

AITA?I (21M) work in a factory 40 hours a week. We're allowed to stay an hour after work every day for overtime (which is 1.5x pay) and stay 3 hours on Fridays (also 1.5x) I have never done overtime because I don't enjoy working here, I'm not a lazy worker by any means but I clock in at the exact start time and clock out at the exact finish time.

I get driven to work by a coworker who sometimes does the overtime and this is no big deal to me since I'll just wait in the canteen or in the cafe across the road. A couple of coworkers have mentioned to me that I'm not being a team player and because I don't stop it means they have to work harder. I told one of them "you don't have to work harder you also have the option not to stay overtime" he told me "that isn't the attitude to have" 

I've been asked to stay this Friday and I said no, my coworker is going to stay so I said it's nbd I'll bring a book to read or something for 3 hours. A few coworkers tend to roll their eyes when it's bought up I'm not doing OT. 

I don't think I'm TA since I'm following my employment contract to the letter but I'm curious what reddit thinksMy husband and I have a 4 year old. I love her to pieces, she’s my lil potato, but every parent knows the struggle of having to share everything you eat with your kid. Whenever she sees me eating, she wants some. 99.9% of the time I share with her because it’s not a huge deal.

Today I had an awful day at work, so I picked up some food from my favorite restaurant on the way home. I just wanted to lay down and enjoy my fries. I try to hide it but kiddo barges into the room and wants my food. This time I didn’t feel like sharing with her, so I told her no.

Kiddo gets increasingly upset, starts crying and throwing a tantrum, but I just tell her that mommy had a rough day and she can eat one of her snacks in the cupboard if she’s hungry (she’d already eaten dinner), and try to explain that people don’t always have to share with her. I remain totally calm and try to leave the room.

Husband comes in and gets mad that I’m not sharing and causing our kid to have a meltdown. I’m like seriously? Can I just enjoy my favorite food in peace after a rough day? Apparently not and I’m an asshole for not sharing! :/

Long story short, kid ends up getting my fries and I end up crying in the bathroom feeling like an awful mom for being angry about it. My husband says that it’s “not a big deal to share” and says I’m an asshole for not sharing. He told me that kids are better at sharing than I am. I told him that I deserve to enjoy one meal by myself in the comfort of my bed after having a godawful day and we don’t want to teach our daughter that she gets whatever she wants when she wants it. So now we’re both angry at each other.

AITA here?

ETA: My husband and daughter had already eaten right before I came home. I asked my husband to keep our daughter out of the bedroom but she got in anyways.So heres the situation:

I'm at a university and I live with 2 other roommates. They decided without me that next year they don't want to live with me anymore, which I wasn't super happy with but whatever. They're both two of my closest friends so it was a shock. They found another one of their close friends they want to live with instead. 

I told them yesterday that I have no intention of moving out. I think that if they want a change in the living situation thats fine, they can change it. Its not my job to find a new apartment when I already have on I like, and there is nothing they can legally due to force me to leave. I have 2 friends who are happy to move in and take their places. 

They did not take it well, and one of them now refuses to talk to me, and absolutely hates me.  

Their argument is there are 2 of them so I should leave, but I'm not the one who wants things to change, so I don't think its on me.  (If im 100% honest i did tour some other places because it would cause a lot less turmoil, but i could not find any nice ones in a good area)

Its super stressful for me possibly losing 2 friends but to be honest if this is all it takes, clearly they weren't very good friends to begin with.My friend recently sent me screenshots of a group chat she has with her friends. One of these people is a newly graduated, licensed, and hired professional fire fighter/paramedic, we'll call her FF. In the group chat FF sent a screen shot of her emergency including the person's age, address, hospital, emergency, and weight.

FF then goes on a rant about the patient, as the patient is almost 600 pounds. FF says she is going to sue the patient for FF now needing a chiropractor and that obese people should be left to die in their houses. FF then sends a picture of the patient being loaded into the ambulance saying "one less obese patient in the world wouldn't upset me or my back." My friend and the entire group chat ganged up on FF to tell her that not only is it her job to help anyone, but also what she's saying is incredibly disgusting and that she should be ashamed to be so judgmental, especially with her profession. FF is now no longer talking to that group.

I am not friend of FF and received screenshots from her friend. The friend group is just cutting off contact with FF, but I want to reach out to her job. I am incredibly offended that someone who is supposed to be helping others would be so outwardly cruel. I would never want someone like this in charge of the care of myself or a loved one. So, I am considering contacting her place of work with these screenshots, besides it might also violate HIPAA.  I was a trained EMS (different from paramedic I know), but we were told explicitly to never share information of our emergencies/patients.

For what it is worth, FF has a 4yo daughter and is in the middle of a custody battle. FF leaves her daughter at her parents 90% of the time and FF refuses to let the father see his child. When FF bothers to care for her daughter she brings the daughter to parties and has the child take "shots" (with juice) with the adults and has the child join the drinking games. Losing her job could also contribute to her losing the rights to her child.

So, is it worth contacting FF's workplace and WIBTA for doing so?For this semester I was adamant on only taking mon-thurs classes that ends early in the afternoon, cause fuck rush hour right- So I signed up for a bunch of electives within that time frame, one of them being African lit- I also got my friend to take it as well, cause were carpooling.

The class was interesting- prof gave an overview of the syllabus (which was available on our student portal, but me being me, I didn’t read any of it yet) but then I saw that my friend looked overwhelmed, and when I asked why he’s like he thought it would be about African American lit- not pure African lit- cause all the topics were Africa centric, the women issues there, child trafficking, works by Achebe & Nwapa etc, all extremely new to both of us. Not gonna lie, i also thought it was gonna be African American, but oh well, that’s my fault for not checking the syllabus.

So once the prof left, we started discussing abt whether to take or drop this, cause it’s quite challenging  since we don’t have any prior knowledge on any of it, but I’m like we gotta take this class, cause the only other elective is on Friday. Then  suddenly a girl that sat behind us called us racists. 

I think I stared at her for a bit. Like just, turned around and looked at her. And I guess I had a bitch resting face or something cause she immediately followed that up with ‘don’t take this class if you’re not going to treat it with respect” 

before I could even say anything my friend already responded, something along the lines of 'what the fuck did you say to me white girl'- and that girl suddenly said she had a percentage of African in her, cause she took the 23andme test and she’s taking this class to connect with her heritage- 

And when she said that, I just straight up started laughing because. It was so fucking out of the blue? I can’t deal with awkward shit like this man. What the hell are you suppose to respond to that? my friend joined in,  and then the other students asked us what's up, my friend repeated the whole 23andme thing and they laughed at her too.

The girl just kept quiet and packed her shit. When she’s abt to  leave I just blurted out see you next week.  I didn’t mean it in a mean way, I truly just meant. See u next week.  I just wanted to move on from that awkward situation I think. She shot me the dirtiest look ever before she left. I felt a little bad. I don’t know. The whole thing was so stupid. 

The class rep told us in our messaging forum that the girl dropped the class, and told the prof it was because she was bullied by us. The prof asked the class rep what happened, and I'm not sure what the class rep said, but none of us got into trouble about it. 

My friend didn't think anything we said/did was actually 'bullying', but I wonder if that's true. I didn't mean to make fun someone's ancestry or something, I just didn't think someone would call me a racist for taking up a class to fit my schedule. 

\- I don't know if this is relevant, but both me & my friend aren't black, but were POCs. 

- also I’m doing my masters- my degree was in education & european lit, so my final thesis will centre on that. Neither of us have ever taken African lit as an undergrad, so we felt like it would be challenging to do it at a masters level. (but we’re taking it anyway, cause it’s interesting and the prof is rad)My gf and I need to find a new place to live in 2 months. We currently live in a two bedroom condo owned by a friend of hers. Her friend graciously said we could stay here for a 3 months after our baby was born.

My gfs parents have offered to give my gf her inheritance early for a down payment on a house for me and my gf and our son if we move over to the town where they live. They’re pretty old and live in an old folks home so they can’t make it over here to visit often.

My gf was very happy about it because she hates us four all living together in this small condo and wants our son to grow up with a yard. So she accepted right when they told her. When I came home had already told our roommate and she was on the couch FaceTiming with them and looking at houses.

My problems with this is it would add a whole lot of time to my commute, all my friend and family are here, and my gf doesn’t want me to also be on the title of the house unless we’re married. 

Im not ready to marry her and don’t know when or if I ever will be. Before she got pregnant with our son we were in a very casual relationship. We’ve gotten closer since our son was born, but I wouldn’t say we’re in love with each other or anything. I just moved in with her so I could help raise our son.

So if I wasn’t allowed on the title with her I told her I wanted a contract saying I get what I put into the house if we break up because I going to be the one paying the mortgage.

I told her the other option is that I will move back into my parents place (they offered with no rent) while I save up a bit more for a down payment and buy a house on my own. Considering housing prices, my salary, my current savings, and our expenses it would probably take me a year. She is of course welcome to come live at my parents and at whatever house I get.

She hates both those ideas and says I’m an asshole because she’s just trying to protect herself, but so am I.

She can’t afford to move closer to her parents without me. She also doesn’t want to live with my parents because she says my mom is pushy about how to raise the baby. Which I admit she can be, but she means well.

Edit. So I got to talking with my dad about everything during lunch. He helped me get to the conclusion that this relationship isn’t going to work and I need to break up with her.

I’m going to move in with my parents while I save for my own house. Then get a lawyer to get custody rights and child support set up.

I’ll pay the last two months rent on our current place and just do what I can to help her figure out what she wants to do for herself after that. My dad still says she can stay with us for a year if she can’t figure out somewhere else to live.This is really hard for me to share. I have purging disorder. It's like bulimia but no binge. I'm 25 and started getting help which was hard because everyone associates throwing up with bulimia (or worse "bulemia" and "bullemia") and gets dismissive. 

I've been purge free for the first time since I was 10. I hadn't been to a dentist since I was 12. Well obviously, my teeth are fucked. Now when I made the appointment I was clear that it's been a long time since I'd been to a dentist and have an eating disorder, and asked if I could schedule with a kind dentist because it was already scary for me. They said of course, they understand.

When I had the appointment...that's not what happened. The person who started the cleaning and exam was very rough and as soon as she got into it she made this long deep sigh and said "Let me guess, you're bulimic?"

I started to say "No, I have purging disorder" and she cut me off as soon as I said no and said something like "Please don't lie to me. It's not going to help you or me. We're going to have to (bunch of stuff I don't remember/understand."

I said "No, you don't understand. I don't have bulimia, I have--" she cut me off and said "It doesn't matter. You have severe enamel erosion, several of your teeth have X and Y."

I said "IT'S PURGING DISORDER" because I thought if I said "no" again she would catapult me. 

She said "Okay, sure, "purging disorder"" with air quotes and rolled her eyes.

I'm not proud of it but I started to cry because it was already so anxiety-inducing for me. She got annoyed and took off her gloves, threw them away, and said she would be back when I calmed down. Instead of calming down, I just got my things and left without paying anything. I cried in my car but shook it off and ended up going home. 

When I got home I was still really upset and so I started writing reviews left and right about the situation. I think I left one on like 7 sites. About two weeks later, I got a call. It was someone from that dental practice who had matched my name with my appointment and was wanted to discuss my reviews and how I was obviously very upset, but was leaving those reviews really necessary.

I said yes, it was, to prevent anyone else from having the same humiliating experience. She argued with me that it wasn't going to change anything or fix my teeth. I lied and said that I had already seen another dentist who had managed to treat me with dignity and respect and hung up. On the sites you can reply to reviews, someone responded to me and tried to pretend they worked with me to figure it out.

I've talked about this in my therapy group and with friends. A bunch of people are telling me I'm wrong because 1-star reviews can really hurt small businesses and how it's not their fault they aren't trained better, but I shouldn't take it out on them. I don't know. I think people need to know. AITA? Is it really that bad?Throwaway for anonymity. 

I (20s F) started a new office job a little over a month ago. Hours of 9-5, pay for 7.5 hours so there’s no pay for a 1/2 hour break. For the first while, I was not taking any break and leaving at 4:30. My supervisor pulled me aside after a couple weeks of that and said they would prefer I not do that unless I had an appointment as they wanted their employees to be there during the 9-5 period. 

To me that kind of sucked but was fair enough. If they didn’t want me to leave until 5, I can respect that. So I started leaving at the typical time and taking 1/2 hour break in the day sometime between 12 and 2 instead. 

Today at about 1:15 I was heading out the door for lunch when my supervisor stopped me and said she had a task she needed me to do. I told her I would do it once I got back as I was going for lunch. She looked confused. She said she thought I didn’t take a lunch break. I told her I wasn’t before as I was leaving early instead but as they didn’t want me leaving early, I wasn’t and was taking a 1/2 lunch at some point instead. 

She said she didn’t know that my not leaving early meant I would be taking breaks in the middle of the day instead. I told her legally I was entitled to that. She said yes she knew that. We stared at each other saying nothing for a good 20 seconds more before I finally said “okay well just leave those documents on my desk and when I get back I’ll complete them for you.” And I left. 

My supervisor has been somewhat cool to me for the rest of the day. When I said by to her at 5, she didn’t even smile or say bye back, just “okay.” 

Am I somehow the ah here?The first thing I would like to point out is that I’ve never and will never do this at a restaurant. I used to work in the restaurant industry and I know how frustrating it is dealing with fake allergies. When I go out to eat, it’s usually just with my BF who understands. So at restaurants I only say I’m lactose intolerant. 

 I (23F) am quite lactose intolerant. Small amounts of dairy give me gas and large amounts force me into the bathroom or the couch for hours. I haven’t eaten dairy in over 3 years. There’s been other benefits to not eating dairy for me as well besides just not upsetting my stomach. My skin is better, I don’t feel sick all the time and I’m happy with non dairy products. 

For some reason whenever I turn down food or ask if I can have any special accommodation and cite it’s because I’m lactose intolerant, people love to chime in with “but people who are lactose intolerant can handle small amounts of dairy! Try this!” Or “there’s not much lactose in butter you’ll be fine with a little bit.” Not taking my no for an answer and I feel like it’s so annoying and demeaning my choices. 

My last job was the WORST for this. When I started my most recent job a few months ago, they brought in birthday cake and offered me some.  I said “no thank I can’t have dairy” When they asked if it was an allergy, without thinking I said “yes but only if I ingest it so feel free to enjoy your own!” 

I’ve kept this up at work since and it’s so refreshing to not have people hound me all the time to eat dairy. My manager actually brought me some Oreos last week when she brought chips ahoy cookies in for everyone else because she knew they didn’t had dairy! It was really sweet. 

I told my BF about this the other day and he says while he gets why I did it, it’s not really right to lie. My argument is since it’s only if I ingest it I can’t have dairy, and I’m not stopping anyone else at work from ever eating it it wouldn’t be a problem. If people weren’t so pushy about food I wouldn’t have had to resort to this. 

So verdict. AITA? Or does everyone including me suck (I guess I feel like it’s more this).Obligatory throwaway. Happened this past weekend.

So my boyfriend and I were visiting my sister and her boyfriend at their new house. When we step in my sister is like “please take off your shoes, we just got the floors professionally cleaned last week.” Awkward. 

So I pause for a bit because I don’t feel super comfortable going barefeet because her bf has a really well known foot thing. I know this because my sister told me about it when they first started dating. Also she’s told me in recent years it’s gotten stronger and he’s apparently told her that bare feet is almost pornographic for him.

Anyways I pull her to the side and kinda hint at my concerns but she got really offended, saying her bf wouldn’t look at me. But I feel like if some woman walked around topless or equivalent in your house...you’d probably look?

In the end she dug out slippers for me from their moving boxes but it took forever and it was super awkward. She was also supremely mad at me since her bf ended up spending like 2 seconds with us before going back to his office to work. Maybe I overreacted but was I an asshole to refuse to go barefoot because I felt uncomfortable?

Edit: I didn’t want to wear just socks because I’m sure that’s not much better. I didn’t want him to see the shape of my feet, PERIOD.So I (20F) have food allergies but it’s not what people think. I don’t go into anaphylaxis or need an epi-pen, it’s a very mild reaction except for it can stick with me for days afterwards. The most notable is my tomato allergy. It’s high in citric acid (the main issue) and causes blisters in my mouth that can fill with blood and bust for weeks after I eat something with tomato in it and they just don’t heal up quickly because I sort of have to keep eating even if they’re there. Don’t get me wrong, I love pizza, marinara sauce and the like but there will ALWAYS be a price to pay afterwards. Sometimes I’m just more equipped to deal with it than others, and it’s very small amounts can cause the blisters. 

With this, the other day my friends and I went to a fast food place and I just wanted a cheeseburger with extra cheese, lettuce, and mayo. Usually I like ketchup but today I didn’t think I could handle the blisters so I skipped it. When I got my order, there was tomato on it, which is no big deal. I took it up and asked them to remake it and went to sit down. Except when I was called up almost a minute later they handed me my food which was very fast for a remake. After I sat down I checked and, sure enough, I could see a seed that came from the tomato they had just picked off which was an issue because the juice it left behind alone is enough to cause the blisters. 

I took it back up and told them that I needed them to remake it and not just pick off the tomato, that it already defeated the purpose by coming in contact with the rest. The cashier tried to argue with me that it wasn’t a real allergy since tomato wasn’t in their allergen book (it’s a relatively uncommon allergy, I’ll admit) and that there was no reason to remake it. From here I told her I wanted to talk to her manager and a refund since I just wanted to go somewhere that wasn’t going to try and force me to eat an allergen. She’s mad but she gets her manager and after about twenty minutes of arguing with him he gives me the refund and says I can keep the burger I already had (I threw it out because I can’t eat it). 

Afterwards when I left with my friends they told me that I was making the cashier’s life difficult and I should have just picked it off and ate it because “you’ve done it plenty before” and “it’s not like you’re deathly allergic”. While it’s true, I really didn’t feel like dealing with a few weeks of blisters just because. While I could have just eaten it, I really don’t feel like it’s right I should have to suffer just because it would makes their lives a bit easier. So AITA because I kicked up a fuss over something that’s arguably stupid?Hi, all!
I’m on mobile, so I apologize for any formatting issues.

Last night, I got pulled over by a police officer. He had said that I didn’t use my turn signal when I was coming out of a parking lot. I don’t have an issue with this and was willing to take my ticket and be on my way.

Towards the end of our interaction, when he was handing my information back along with said ticket, he requested my phone number and address. I asked why he needed it and he said, verbatim, “just give it to me otherwise I can’t let you go”.

I ended up giving him the info but I’m unhappy that I couldn’t get a real reason why he needed it. I discussed it with my mother and she said that I could file a formal complaint against the officer because he made me uncomfortable.

Would I be the asshole for reporting the officer?

EDIT: I moved states a week ago and I have 30 days to update my information. I notified the police officer of this as I handed over my information. When he approached me to return my paperwork, he first asked for my new address and then asked for my phone number. When I asked why he needed that information, he said what I had stated above.

EDIT 2: The cop handed me my ticket and THEN proceeded to ask for my address and phone number, which he recorded into a small notebook.

EDIT 3: I am 22F

UPDATE: I called the number on the ticket to ask an officer if a phone number is required. The officer had me explain exactly what happened and he told me that in this state (TN) asking for a phone number is not normal and being told that I have to provide one before I could be released is unprofessional. The address was not an issue, as was confirmed from the officer I spoke with, and the officers supervisor will be in contact with me later today. Thank you all!I (19F) suffer badly from thyroid issues and chronic fatigue. I’m 5ft 8 and I weigh 85kg, a little over weight but a lot of that is on my chest and thighs. I’m quite lucky in the fact I have a body like kylie, just with a bigger stomach. Sure I could stand to loose a few pounds, but I’m not overly unhealthy and I personally think that’s what’s important.

My mum made things difficult for the rest of my family, and when I became sick at 12 cut them all off. This was a hit to me as I grew up without a dad and one of my uncles was the closest thing I had to a father figure. Me and said uncle, let’s call him joe, have always gotten on very well. There’s only a 12 year age gap between us. 

My other uncle, let’s call him Ron, I never really knew well but he has a child. Ron is only 11 years older than me. I think he’s always been quite jealous of the fact joe is my favourite uncle, but I can’t really help that, Ron never put in the effort with me as a child. That said, he was also never given the chance.

After 7 years I got back in contact with joe when I hit 18 and traveled half way across the country to go see him. Everything with him and his wife was great and they were very welcoming. But Ron’s child kept saying weird things to me like ‘ you’re only coming up to spend uncle joes money ‘. I have a job and I pay for everything myself, so I don’t know where he’s getting these things from. If anything Ron pays for things and then brags about it to everyone after, despite me always offering to pay.

My mum refuses to build her bridges with joe and that’s fine. She invited Ron and his child over for Christmas though. I was having a mental breakdown to the point I was going to throw myself off a bridge and was crying in my room. My mum was meant to cancel it but said she just couldn’t tell him no. 
This child has made a few comments about my weight in the past but I brushed it off. The final straw for me was when he came down at Christmas and refused to eat his dinner because ‘ I don’t want to end up as fat as her ‘. After he said that I went up to my room and didn’t bother with any of them the Rest of the time they were there. I talked to my mum after she left and she was astounded her brother didn’t say anything.

The child himself is very rude and has never been taught manners. He’s also quite literally left to his own devices, watching Freddie kruger and Jason on YouTube in his spare time.
I don’t really want comments like that, for obvious reasons. I think it hit more because I was down.
I also theorise kids don’t notice many of these things, so he must be getting it from my uncle Ron.

AITA for not visiting them because if the comments the child has made?On mobile, format sorry etc. 
Last night my friend (30f) video chatted me and was huddled in a room with her 2 kids under 5. She was crying and the kids were terrified. I can hear her husband raging in the background. She tells me he barricaded her in the kitchen and wouldn't let her leave. He has some mental health issues and uses them to get my friend to accept a lot of verbal abuse. This is not the first time she has called me scared. It's not even the first time this week. I've told her I need to call the police but she begs me not to because she doesn't want CPS involved because they have had 3 incidents with them before due to her husband's behavior. 

Last night I was on the phone with her for 2 hours and I just couldn't take it anymore. I called the cops. Sure enough CPS is going to get called in again and their landlord told them that if the cops come to his residence one more time for a domestic (they've been called by the neighbors for fights between the husband and his brother), he's terminating their lease. 

I feel guilty that I have opened a can of worms for them. Because I am a domestic abuse survivor, I am wondering if me calling the cops was a triggered response and a selfish motive. 

He sent me some hateful texts and she won't speak to me now. 

I think I've ruined my friendship and she's going to end up with one less support.

Should I have minded my own business? My wife (27F) and I (32M) got married in July. We've been together for 7 years, but during most of that time have lived far away from our places of origin and our friends and family. Unfortunately, this means I've had very little chance to get to know her friends from childhood. One of my wife's friends (F) has recently become a divorce attorney. I had met F once before, very briefly, in a crowded bar on Halloween, but otherwise did not know this person. My wife considers AFa friend from childhood but I don't think F is a person she talks to regularly. F came to our (joint) wedding shower in my wife's hometown but not to our wedding. F gave us a nice card and shower gift, but also slipped in her business card as a divorce attorney with a saucy line about her availability if my wife ever needed it. My wife chuckled and thought it was clever. I thought it was incredibly tasteless and offensive. I get they're old friends with an existing relationship, but I have essentially no relationship with this person, and she had to know I would see it (it was in a card for both of us, that we opened together in front of everyone at the shower). My wife thinks I'm just stodgy and humorless. AITA (or just a generally humorless stick in the mud)?This happened a while back buts it’s always bugged me so reddit...am I the asshole for calling the police on my mom. 

She drove in town to celebrate with my wife and I over drinks. I had just graduated with an MBA and we were all pretty excited. My wife was DD and we agreed to leave my moms car at the bar and come back for it the next day. 

After more fireball than was probably necessary mom and I are plastered and wife says it’s time to leave. 

Mom and I can barely walk straight and we get in the car to grab something to eat. While eating mom says “you know I feel fine take me back to my car. I’ll just drive it to your place.” Wife says no because mom is clearly drunk. Slurring words, barely awake even. 

Mom suddenly panics and starts opening the car door while we are driving. I beg her to stop and so does my wife but she keeps opening the door and even gets a leg out. 

After a few minutes of fear and yelling I tell my mom if she won’t stop trying to exit the car while we’re driving I’ll have to call for help. She won’t comply so finally I called the police. 

They encouraged us to pull over so we did even though there wasn’t a good place to do that. Mom gets out and starts walking/stumbling up the road until some blue lights pull up behind her. 

The officers tell her to get back in our car and not drive tonight. She says “I’ll get in the car but as soon as I’m free I’ll drive my car wherever I want” so they took her to the jail. She blames me for the entire incident to this day. We choose not to bring it up because it’s always an argument. My brother even called me and left me a two minute voicemail about what a shit I am for calling the cops on mom. 

I have hated myself for getting her sent to jail but my wife says it’s entirely her own fault for her behavior. 

So AITA?Hello Reddit! This one’s a little weird but hopefully you guys can give me some perspective.

So in our house we have a spider that hangs out in the bathroom. I have affectionately named him “Gargoth, Destroyer of Pests, King of the Poop Palace.” I will greet him when I go in there and to be honest he’s become like a pet to me in a really weird, non conventional way. He helps keep our bathroom pest-free and he stays out of our way. I have become attached to him. He has also grown on my wife and we both like having him around.

Now Gargoth is pretty intimidating because he’s large and in charge. Guests were constantly getting spooked by him. So my wife and I started warming people about him and explaining he’s harmless and to please leave him be.

Well my SIL hates spiders and has tried to kill Gargoth many times despite us asking her not to. The other day she managed to knock him off the wall and probably killed him (we have not seen him since). I got really upset and haven’t talked to SIL since she murdered Gargoth in cold blood. I am particularly upset that she just ignored what my wife and I asked and killed him.

My in-laws are obviously confused and some think I am the asshole for being so upset over a spider but man, Gargoth was my buddy!

AITA?I know this sounds bad but let me explain.

My bf (20) and I (20F) have been dating for two years. Him and his brother (21M) still live at home so I see his brother pretty often when I’m over because he’s unemployed. The first few times I interacted with him he said some troubling things to my bf like “why would I get a job when I can mooch off of dad forever?” (Their dad gives him a monthly allowance) I mentioned to my bf later that wasn’t nice of his brother to say especially because I was aware his father was having trouble retiring with all of his brother’s expenses. I was told he can’t help it because he has Aspergers. Because my sister is also on the spectrum, I know people with autism can say hurtful things and not realize it so I accepted that at the time.
However, my bf has now told my stories about how his brother used to go into their sister’s room when they were in high school, watch her sleep, and steal her expensive clothes/jewelry to resell. The sister eventually installed a lock requiring a key on her door because no one could get him to stop. They even tried a psychologist. My bf brushed it off again by saying his brother couldn’t understand it was bad because he has Aspergers. He is also an avid trump supporter and tries to make extremely racist/sexist jokes around me because he knows it upsets me. 
Their father has tried for years to make him get any job at all, but he refuses. He has a social worker to help him with the job process and his father has offered to help him see a therapist if he’s having anxiety around having a job or something. He refuses. 
Because he’s 21 and financially has nothing, his dad told my bf and all of the other siblings, at some point their brother might need help and a place to live. My bf and I were casually discussing this and he said once we’re more financially stable and living together he would consider getting a two bdrm apartment so his brother could live with us. At that point I said sorry but I wouldn’t be comfortable with that. I explained that if someone literally couldn’t be made to stop stealing until there was a physical barrier in the way, I didn’t want them around my belongings. I also said that his jokes and his attitude make me dislike him. My bf was kind of mad and said I shouldn’t be judgmental because his brother has Aspergers and can’t control it, but we don’t have to discuss it until it’s actually relevant to our living situation. 
I think he’s completely wrong. I think I’m rightly judging his actions just like I would with any person. I honestly think it’s ableist to say he’s not responsible for any of his behavior just because he has Aspergers. It’s like my boyfriends family has the perception that people with Aspergers inherently do bad things because they don’t know any better and can’t learn. 

So AITA for disliking my bf’s brother and not excusing his bad behavior?

Just as a note there’s a lot more negative behaviors I see from his brother but I decided to only mention the biggest ones.My husband and I are expecting our first baby, a baby girl. Turns out that my husband’s sister is also expecting her first baby... also a little girl who will be born a little under 3 months after ours. We are of course thrilled for her. However the news has unfortunately come with huge family drama. Sister-in-law has been demanding for months now that we tell her what we’ll name our little girl and that we show her what birth announcement cards we’ve chosen,... basically everything. My husband and I on the other hand wish to keep especially the name a secret, we haven’t told anyone and want to share the name only when she’s born. Since we refuse to tell, this has led to a huge family drama with SIL who has been angry with us eversince. She claims that she cannot name her child and that we are selfishly ruining her experience because the risk of her choosing the same name would be huge. My husband and I however want to enjoy having at least this one secret (we already told the sex of the child) and think that there are plenty of babynames in the world to choose from and that the risk of her choosing the same name is almost non-existent (especially since, as we’ve told her, the name that we’ve chosen is very uncommon). 
Last weekend she had another tantrum and now I’m especially sick of it giving that I’m due to give birth any minute now... so she’ll know very very soon anyway so the drama and the stress that it causes really feels unnecessary to me. We do feel awful about the whole drama that it has become and are wondering... Are we the as*holes for not telling her?

EDIT: thank you all so much for your replies, I’ve read them all, loved reading your stories and found some great tips that could help us to (hopefully) straighten out this unfortunate situation. I guess we’ll turn the tables and ask her to share her name choices (and then we can say if our choice is amongst her list). We’ll see if she’s willing to be as open on her name choice as she expects us to be on ours ;-)
Concerning the whole secret thing, I understand that some of you find it a bit strange that it’s so important to us to keep the name a secret but I guess it’s a cultural thing? I don’t know why really, nobody ever shares the names of their babies before birth here where we live. I guess it’s seen more as a surprise than a secret now that I think about it. Most people don’t even tell if it’s a boy or a girl. :-)Backstory: I’m a cosmetologist and have been dying my hair with a 1N (darkest black they sell) for a year and a half, black is hard to get out of hair, my sister is getting married and asked me to change my hair back to our natural color (dark brown). My sister and I have been going to the same hair dresser for 13 years. 

I told my sister that I honestly couldn’t afford to change my hair back to brown because I knew it would be a couple hundred dollars, I also didn’t want to because I feel a lot more comfortable with my black hair. My sister has already started her career and makes a lot more money than I do so she offered to pay for me to get my hair fixed, and booked me the appointment herself. 

Our hairdresser told her it would be a color correction at 90 dollars and hour and would probably take 4 hours, my sister agreed to this and told her that if it took longer that was fine she just wanted it to look nice for the wedding. The day of the appointment the hairdresser texts me and says her coworker is gonna help with it since she squeezed me in for the appointment. 

I go to get my hair done and it takes 4 hours. My hairdresser passes me the iPad and I put in my sisters credit card to pay $550 dollars, including tip (sister told me it was ok to give her 20% before I went). I got up to leave and my hairdresser hands me another iPad and says “this is for her (her coworker). it’s for the product and stuff” and I was like, oh okay. So I started putting in the credit card info again and before I pressed submit I asked how much it was since they never told me. It was 750 dollars. I asked why and she said it was her hourly rate and the price of the product. I started crying, pressed submit on the card and left to my car and immediately called my sister. 

My sister told me to calm down and it would be okay and not to worry about it, and that she would call our hairdresser tomorrow to get this figured out since after tips it was 1500 dollars. My friends are all saying I should have refused to pay, not tipped or argued about the price. I wanted to say something so bad but I was on the verge of a panic attack and I didn’t know what to do.

Edit: I’m paying my sister back as much as possible over the next few months, but the initial charge on her credit card is what I feel awful abtI'm a 22f and I'm getting married in September to my loving fiance 23m. I'm going to preface and say I don't get along with most kids, I have a nephew on my fathers side whom I love but hes my only exception given he's quite alot like me

. My nephew on my mothers side however is another story. He's 10, destructive, disgusting, loud, and just annoys me. On my best days I tolerate him. 

I was out with my mother and my cousin with the 10 year old who I'll just call Pam from here. Pam invited herself along to go look at second hand shops for my wedding dress. 

She wouldn't hush up about the big day. Which hey cool thanks for being excited for me. She kept throwing out ideas that didnt align with what i had in mind. Very small wedding, in the mountains, no gifts, just bring food. 

She then mentioned how cute HER son would be as a ring bearer. I stopped her then and there. I reminded her that this wedding was absolutley no kids. She proceeded to throw a fit.

She didn't think hell spawn counted in that rule because he's soooooo well behaved. I told her the rule was hard and unmoving. My mom wants me to roll over and let hell spawn come but I want so little for mine and my fiancee day. AITA?

TLDR Cousin wants to bring her kid to my wedding and I say hell no

EDIT: I had already clearly stated no kids, this will still be a long celtic pagan ceremony in a location that needs to be hiked into a bit. Im not inviting the nephew I like either. I also uninvited said cousin after she went and made me out to be a baby hater to my mother's side of the family.

EDIT: She threatened to boycott my wedding with some of my other cousins on that side, btw theyre all rednecks with yee yee trucks that are proud they dropped out of high school including Pam. My fiance amd his family are all ex cops or ex military and theyve offered to "escort" unwanted guests out of the ceremony. Awesome people

Edit: I understand he would not be my nephew as hes my cousins kid but thats really how it works in my family cousins kids who are younger just get called nieces and nephews, weird I know.I am 22. My mom began abusing morphine when I was ~2 (from what I understand). She was fired when I was 7 and became a stay at home “mom” even though I was in school 8 hours a day. Without all the details, she was not a good mom. Always k/o from the morphine, she HATED spending time with me, once when I was 4 I spent 2 weeks in the ICU and she left me there by myself then got angry at *me* when years later I said that was the only thing I remember from being sick.

A year ago while I was nearly done with college she decided to detox herself and was in full blown psychosis and destroying the house for 5 days before I called 911 after she was threatening to murder people and refused to give up her Glock. She also said she “woke up” driving down the highway and laughed about it and refused to give up her keys. 

My dad was pissed at me for getting the police involved. I lived with them at the time, so it was very stressful. I was even ran over in a hit and run while walking to class after speaking to the police and EMTs. The police refused to pull camera footage to track down the car over some jurisdiction dispute.


My mom has supposedly been clean for about 8 months. Great for her, but I don’t really care.


About a month ago I moved to a different city. My mom kept going on and on about missing “her baaaaaabyyyyy” (????) and calls me all the time. I either don’t answer or just give the shortest possible answers to her questions. She left a voicemail crying about why don’t I love her anymore and when am I going to **move back in with them** (never?).

I have a much older brother (35) who thinks we need to be supportive so we can “have our mom back”. This is the only mom I’ve ever had, I guess he remembers before she was an addict. I don’t.

ETA my mom isn’t the person that tried to run me over, it was another student.I live in an on campus appartment for college which has 3 bedrooms, 1 bathroom, and 5 people sharing community spaces. At the beginning of the school year we wrote up a roommate agreement stating that dishes should be cleaned within 12 hours of use and we rotate weekly chores which should be done over the weekend.

My roommate, Megan, and I are always picking up the slack for our other roommates. We're constantly putting their dishes away because they'll leave them in the sink for days if the drying rack is full, one of the other roommates doesn't get the dishes clean when she washes them there's always chunks of food still present, and we always have to remind them to do their chores. (Side note: we share dishes all of our dishes except for one roommate who doesnt share anything with the rest of us but will use our stuff) Megan and I are tired of having to parent them, it's not our job and they're all adults.

Megan and I provided almost all of the decorations for the living room and it looks really nice and inviting. I've allowed everyone to use my TV and playstation, even my accounts for hulu and netflix. Now that our roommates have gotten comfortable, they're constantly bringing their SO over and using the living room. While this is fine, I never get the opportunity to use my electronics because they're either using them or talking loudly while I'm watching TV. I suggested to Megan that we move all of the decorations and electronics to our room so that we could actually enjoy them but WIBTA? 

All of this stuff has been in the living room for months so it would be obvious that we just don't want the other roommates to enjoy our stuff anymore. We just feel like we're being taken advantage of.So this happened last month. Me (18f) and my cousin (18f) both applied to the same highly prestigious university, it's the best in the UK & one of the best in the world. I'm not saying that to gloat about the fact I got in but because it explains why going there is a much bigger deal than any other uni. It might also be important to mention that our dad's are brothers and do not get on very well and our grandparents are closer to my dad.

We both applied. She got rejected. I got in. The next week, we were at our grandparents and she seemed visibly upset with me. I let this slide, the uni had been her dream for far longer than it had been mine. Throughout the day, her and her parents kept rolling their eyes whenever my acceptance got mentioned. Eventually over dinner, my grandfather gave a toast to my acceptance to the uni AND her acceptance to her second choice uni. 

At this point, she ran out crying and I followed her because even though we're not close I wanted to see if she's okay. She said it was unfair I got accepted because I don't work as hard as her and that she's wasted years of her life on getting into this uni and it's been ruined by people like me.

This took me by surprise. I'll admit I do juul, drink, and smoke weed recreationally but I still work exceptionally hard. Both academically and recreationally. I told her that I do in fact work harder and that maybe she simply wasn't as good as she thought. I also said that it was not my fault she had no social life, she choose that.

I think I might be TA for saying those things to her while she was upset. AITA for telling her what I though or should I have left it?So my sister (8) had off from school today, and I (22) don’t have any classes on Wednesdays, so she asked if she could hang out with me.

We went grocery shopping this morning, and it was pretty empty, so it was smooth sailing until we were pretty much about to leave. I sent my sister to grab a bundle of bananas while I put some tomatoes in a bag, and she was no more than 5 feet from me. There was an older woman looking at bananas, too, but I knew my sister wasn’t going to be a bother so I figured it was fine. She grabbed a bundle and turned to walk away when the lady stopped her and told her she needed a produce bag, my sister said no thanks and proceeded to walk away. Then the woman came up to me and tried to hand me the bag and I kinda just said thank you, and then put it in my cart. I wasn’t trying to cause a scene, but I also didn’t need my bananas in a bag and was just going to use it for some other produce. But the woman stopped us and said that my sister should have already put them in a bag, and I told her it wasn’t necessary. She turns to my sister and goes “don’t listen to your mama, you need to put all produce in a bag” I told her “first, I’m her sister. Second, who do you think you are trying to parent other people’s children? You need to mind your damn business” and then she asks me “didn’t your mama teach you how to respect people?” And I told her “no ma’am, my mama’s been dead for years. But my dad taught me not to take any bullshit from annoying old women. Have a nice day” and dragged my sister away from her. I saw her go up to an employee, but didn’t hear what she was saying but I could see she wasn’t pointing at us and looking at us, but we just grabbed our final few things. AITA? As we were leaving there was the guy she talked to and another girl standing by the door and watching us leave, made me feel like maybe I did do the wrong thing.Gonna try to keep this short and sweet. My daughter is 20 years old and has a severe panic disorder. She recently (6 weeks ago) lost her job, which means she lost her health insurance, and she moved back home to get back on her feet.

My daughter was prescribed Xanax but can no longer afford the doctor’s visits or prescription costs. My wife and I are also struggling financially and can‘t afford to pay for her either. I also take Xanax for the same disorder, but don’t take them often, so I have a decent amount sitting around in case of an emergency. 

Yesterday morning my daughter had a horrible panic attack. It got to the point where her mother wanted to take her to the ER. However having been in the same situation I knew 1) the ER would just sedate her and keep her for observation and 2) we can’t afford it.

So instead I gave my daughter one of my Xanax. 30 minutes later my daughter is fine and takes a nap.

My wife is pissed with me. She’s always been against medications/therapy and I had to fight tooth and nail to get myself and my daughter treatment. She says what I did was illegal (technically true) and fucked up. My argument is that my daughter takes the exact same medication and dosage, just can’t afford it. And the ER was gonna do the same damn thing!

AITA here???Long story short, an old boss of mine's wife is a floor nurse (LPN) at a local hospital. She's an avid anti-vaxxer , and shares the mis information over facebook and will argue anyone left and right when they try to correct her. I know the hospital has a policy on them being able to use your Facebook as means for disciplinary action.

What I feel bad about is that she, to my knowledge, didn't share her view with patients, although she might or could have. I also feel bad that she could lose her job, but I feel that, as a nurse, you shouldn't be helping the misinformation, and be rightfully informed yourself. So I’m a law student (F) who has recently moved into my bfs apartment. We’ve been dating for a really long time (7 years) but have decided that now is as good a time as any to live together as my lease was ending.

My main issue is that my bfs apartment is located in a more sketchy area. It’s right by the main college’s campus but it’s also nearby a soup kitchen and the area directly behind our complex isn’t the best. Now, due to this there are some homeless people constantly walking around, which tbh doesn’t bother me. Normally everyone just minds there own way. There is really good security around campus and the cops patrol around our complex frequently as well.

Well today, I went to go get groceries and I was driving back home with a trunkful. My bf was just heading home from work so it was already dark outside. As I pull into my parking complex, I take a second to text him on my phone, and am completely spooked by this homeless man. He was knocking on the window of my car begging for money. Honestly it freaked me out. I tried to shake my head no, but he kept banging on my car window.

Eventually I drove off with him angrily screaming at me for help (my windows were up the whole time) and called my counties police nonemergency line. By the time I had driven around my block three times he had moved on to the pizza place across the street , and there was a cop car next to him.

I took my groceries upstairs to our apartment, and by this time my bf was home. I told him what happened and he said I was the asshole. He said that cops are known for treating homeless  people poorly and that i was going to get this poor man arrested for just trying to live.

In my eyes, the reason I called the police was because I was alone and he’s a lot bigger than me, and he was banging on my property.

So, AITA?(This happened during my senior year of high school, roughly within a year ago.) Anyway, my mom and I have different clothing standards. So, before I left for my freshman year out-of-state, we had recurrent fights about it. The reason I've been thinking about this is that I just bought my spring wardrobe and clothes were on my mind.

My family is Mormon, and for those of you who don't know, they have extremely strict rules for how you can dress. Women can't show cleavage, expose their shoulders, wear shorts that don't at least go to their knees, wear clothing with cutouts, wear crop tops, wear tight clothes...you get the idea. 

In high school, my mom would have me wear fairly baggy clothing. I was used to this. The last high school jean shopping trip we had, she bought me pants that were TWO SIZES too large. I'm a US size 6 in pants, and she got me ones that were a US 10. (Yes, that was after I tried several sizes on for her.) I was confused about why my pants size had to be so large when I was so thin, and when I googled it, the search results indicated that I probably wore the wrong size (obviously lol). In school, I eventually realized that I was nearly the only girl in class who wore pants that fit the way mine did. So I went to the store and bought jeans that actually fit properly. My mom said they were too tight, but surprisingly she let it slide.

Fast forward to a school day sometime later. It was almost laundry day for me, so I only had a couple shirts I could wear. I chose a long baggy one that was sitting unworn in my closet, and I tied one of the sides with a hair tie so it wouldn't be so baggy/shapeless. The knot fell at the hem of my jeans. When I raised my arms in the air, some skin would show, and my mom hated it. She told me I had to take the knot out right now etc. I said no and told her why. She said it "looked like I was trying to look like someone's sex object" and that if I didn't take the knot out she would drive me to my dad's workplace before school and have him "tell me what the boys would be thinking." (I suddenly felt really ashamed about my clothes but stood my ground.) She called my dad, he agreed to do this.

BUT she had to drop my sister Jane off at the middle school, which was close to the high school, before taking me to my dad's work. So when Jane got out, I jumped out of the other door. I ran like hell to the high school and made it there before the first bell. After school, I furiously accused my mom of slut-shaming me and angrily informed her that I didn't like it when she talked about me or the things I wore that way. However, she thinks she's helping me be "modest" and not look like a sex object, because in order to show respect to your body you have to dress modestly. She said that I'm just pushing the boundaries of what I can wear. I retorted that I did not appreciate it and she absolutely needed to stop. AITA?My wife (28yo) and I (31yo) were invited to a family vacation where my parents rented a house. We learned after we bought plane tickets that we’d have to share a room with my 34 yo sister. My wife and I weren’t to excited about that so we rented our own place 6 mins away. Now my mom is upset that we’re not staying in the house with them. Am I the asshole here for not wanting to share a room?Cousins husband wants discounted child care


Hi guys so this happened over the weekend and I’ve been thinking about it since. So obviously I’m a nanny. I’ve been caring for children for years with all age groups so I have plenty of experience. Well my cousin and her husband had their baby 2 months ago. I love my cousin and the baby but her husband is eh. So I really only come around for her and the baby. They are also a party couple, partied every weekend and some weekdays before they got pregnant. Well they are ready to resume the party life a few times a month which is fine because they are really cutting down now for the baby.

My issue is that they asked me what I would charge them to watch the baby overnight and until 3 on the next day so they can sleep it off. So about 15ish hours of me having their baby. Now the baby is great. He sleeps well and eats well is generally not fussy. But he is still a very young infant and that comes with a lot of risk. So for a baby that young I would charge $200-$250 for an overnight that long. Because again it’s 15 hours. 

Now at first I didn’t want to tell them what I would charge because I wasn’t comfortable talking about it because I knew this would lead somewhere I wasn’t going to like. Well they insisted and I was right. My cousin was okay with this. But her husband. He got mad. Like red in the face mad. Telling me that it was terrible I was charging them so much for a baby so little and that we are family and I shouldn’t be so selfish because they deserve to have fun too. I said yes you’re right. You’re family. I normally wouldn’t care for a baby that young overnight at all so I’m already helping you there. Also I work so much and go to school full time as well. So the weekends are the only time my husband and I get to do things together so that’s my time that’s being used up. 

I was upset and confused. My cousin apologized for him. But I’m just so torn. I love my cousin but I think her husband was out of line here. I’m a nanny this is my livelihood. This is how I pay for my own bills and food. I just don’t feel like I was being unreasonable. I’ve never had a family have an issue with my pricing. 

I just don’t feel comfortable caring for a baby that young overnight for so long and for such little money. He said 100$ is already pushing it and I said then I think you should consider someone else because that’s my rate. 

My husband says I was right and my cousin in secret said she understands and that she isn’t mad at all. The only one upset is her husband. This is also not the first time her husband has lost his crap on someone for something small. He has a history. 

I just don’t know if I should do it anyway for my cousins sake to have fun or say no because it’s my job to care for kids and he was so disrespectful about it. So I was wondering AITA here for not accepting the night babysitting job?Throwaway because my co-workers are on here and they know about it.

So we just hired a new girl at our office. She seems nice, don't know anything about her because she works in a different department and haven't talked to her much.

I'm known for being tech savy so yesterday she came up to my desk to ask me a question about where she can find certain files on the shared drives, so I was walking her through it and when I finished I got a whiff of perfume and asked if it was her wearing it. She said yes, so I said "Oh it smells nice." That was the end of it. Didn't saying anything else. She kind of nodded said thanks and walked away.

Today my boss asks me to come into his office saying the new girl said I made an inappropriate comment towards her. I asked him wtf he was talking about and he said it was about me saying she smelled nice. I told him that I said her perfume smelled nice and that was it, and didn't think that was inappropriate. He pretty much just said don't do it again and that was the end of it.

A good amount of my co-workers in my department know about it and some are saying it's not a big deal it's just a compliment, that's what perfume is for and some are saying that it comes off as creepy to mention it.

I don't think I did anything wrong, AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: Just want to point out that I didn't go around telling my co-workers about the talk with my boss. Someone else from a different department knew I was reported and was asking my co-workers what happened. Last weekend was my sisters wedding, and when we flew there for the weekend everything seemed like it was fine. But the morning of my fiancée got a call from work and some stuff had gone wrong and she was going to have a bunch of work when she got back. 

Now this ordinarily wouldn’t be that big deal for her but it came with a bunch of other stuff she’s going through and the point is she had a panic attack about half an hour before we had to leave. Full on break down, not just a little worried. She was completely non functional. 

After an hour she was a bit better and she told me I should go to the wedding because I wouldn’t be too late(probably 10-15 minutes). But she never prioritizes herself and I couldn’t just leave her in the hotel alone. 

So I called my sister, who didn’t answer so I left a message explaining. We caught an early flight home that day.

After we landed there was a very angry voicemail from my sister and mother, and a bunch of angry texts. Over the past week I’ve tried to apologize and explain but they won’t have it.

AItA here? Did I overcompensate for my fiancée?My wife (27f) and I (25m) have been together 6 years now.

We’re pretty even, chores wise. We split them weird, but I feel like we both pull our weight. We both work from home, we both clean, she’ll manage finances, I’ll do laundry, etc. We don’t currently have a car, nor do we have good public transit, so my mother’s boyfriend ends up picking me up from the house when we need stuff from the store. My wife finds him creepy (for good reason) so she won’t ride in a car with him.

A frequent argument, however, is my forgetfulness.

I honestly try my best when I go, but there are times I forget stuff. For a while she’s been accusing me of only picking up things we need for myself and my kid, and “conveniently” leaving her out. Most of the time I just brush off her complaints as paranoia, because I’m genuinely not meaning to forget stuff. 

Today I noticed that we got our tax return back, my daughter went off to school, so I decided to ask my mom’s boyfriend for a ride to the store to grab a few things we needed. I got a new keyboard and mouse for the computer I use for work/gaming, and a pair of headphones as the last pair we had broke. I also saw a cute stuffed dog and some dinosaur truck toys I knew my daughter would love, so I got them to surprise her and came home.

Wife wakes up from her nap, and she’s not happy. She’s livid that I spent money without her divvying up what needs to be spent on what, but I really didn’t spend that much, so she calms down.. But then, immediately asks me if I got the charger for her tablet. “You know, the charger I’ve been complaining about for the past week because my old one broke and I need my tablet for work?? Something YOU told me to stop complaining about several times because YOU claimed you were well aware I needed one and would grab it once we got the money?” She just kept going on and on about it, and I left the room. 

She claims that whenever I forget stuff, it’s always stuff for her. She’s a picky eater, so we don’t really like the same foods, and sometimes I do end up getting stuff I know I’ll eat or I know our kid will eat, but she’s picky so I don’t really know what to get her most times. When I do laundry, I’m usually just worried about getting clean clothes for our daughter to wear, and might forget to throw things in for her. Sometimes I’ll forget tampons and stuff, but I just have a really shitty memory, and even times I’ve brought lists I still end up forgetting stuff. 

This probably wouldn’t be a big deal if we had easy transportation, but it’s not as simple as just hopping in the car and going back. I literally have to either be lucky and catch my ride when he’s not busy, or schedule something. 

Her argument is that I’m not thinking of her, and she claims that “after six years you should know what I eat or know to throw clothes in the wash for her”, blahblah. Basically, I think she’s being too sensitive, she thinks I’m being inconsiderate. Who knows,  maybe I’m wrong. AITA Reddit?

Edit: Ok guys wow. The fight my wife and I have had has since passed, I was just curious about if I were being insensitive and I think by now it’s clear I have been. But holy, this thread is more heated than the initial fight, calm down. I’m not going to go into our personal financial situation, or every sordid detail of our personal lives just for a fair verdict here because it’s pretty obvious at this point that there’s no such thing.

My wife isn’t lazy. She works more than I do, she handles most of the stuff to do with our daughter when it comes to doctors and teachers and stuff. She’s pretty hard working and stresses herself out a lot to the point where sometimes she does become sensitive about things and it’s hard for me to navigate what I should take seriously, and I’ll admit I am lazy brained. What I thought was just an overreaction to my forgetfulness is probably seen as me never thinking of her. I can work on it, damn.

The amount of people claiming I don’t love my wife, or that she should just do everything herself are making so many speculations you’re making flat earthers and antivax moms look sane. Calm the fuck down, I’ll do better to communicate with her and look into some home delivery stuff.Three things you should know before I begin:

(1) My boyfriend is a delightful human who happens to prefer locally made products, especially products without plastic packaging.

(2) My boyfriend and I live together

(3) I have a life threatening allergy to avocado, for which I have an epi-pen

So We're in Bulk Barn the other day, and he finds these handmade bars of soap in the back. He starts picking them up and sniffing. Finds one he likes, and chucks it in the shopping basket.

Anytime I try a new packaged product, I have to read the label. If I ingest avocado or avo oil, I go into anaphylactic shock and then I die. And in this post-Millennial world, let me tell you, every effing thing seems to have avo in it. E.ver.y.thing.

So I pick up the soap carefully. It's wrapped in a small light cardboard, and the majority of the bar is exposed. I eye over the ingredients list; lo and behold, it contains avodaco oil. I show him and he's bummed.

Now, one detail about my allergy: cross contamination is an issue, but not a huge one. Like, if you used a knife on an avo and wiped it off and sliced something that I were to later eat, I would for sure need a benadryl but I would not likely go into ana-shock.

Back to the story.He starts asking if he can get it anyway, and maybe we can put a second soap dish in the shower? Or maybe he can just put it in his travel case and he can use it only when he goes on work trips?

I really don't like to tell people what to do. I do like to give them as much information as possible and give them the chance to make a good choice. So I tell him, touching the soap won't hurt me but if suds touch my eye/mouth/crotch (I mean, it is in the shower, suds could very well get in the crotchular area), then I am in some trouble. I tell him that this makes me nervous, and am noticeably uncomfortable with this even being an issue. But it is technically his house and I'm not going tell him what he can('t) buy.

He leaves it in the shopping basket, and decides that he'll buy it, and keep it in his travel bag.The chances that I will come to contact with the bar in a life threatening way are low, as long as I remember it's there. I mean, we do travel together and would usually share soap, so I just have to super remember not to use his soap, and not to use soap that's been in his soap case.

I'm not happy that he bought it, and am now wanting to ask him to turf the bar.

The reasons that I want him to turf it are almost completely related to me feeling like it's maybe a bit insensitive that he would bring this thing that could literally kill me into or home. I'm feeling like maybe his desire to smell like eucalyptus and pine outweigh my desire to live without the fear of encountering unnecessary danger.

\*\*EDIT: I did also suggest that he bring it to work, and maybe just use it at work, where I am guaranteed never to be.

Am I the asshole if I tell him to to chuck the soap?My husband and mom have this weirdly close relationship which has been a source of conflict before, usually when he has trouble telling her no.

When I was pregnant, I told my husband that I want it to be just us two in the hospital and we could have friends and family over the house later.

I went into labor prematurely, and my husband rushed us to the hospital in my car. It was unexpected. I gave birth without an epidural because I couldn't get one with the timing, it was the hardest most painful thing I could imagine.

I didn't get hardly any time with our baby at all before the doctors and nurses had to take her away and I was just laying in bed feeling awful, in pain, feeling like "did I do something to make this happen?" I had some risk factors like stress and a past struggle with disordered eating that's left me at a low weight.

Then suddenly my husband's mother came in, asking where the baby was, asking a lot of medical questions like how premature, had I been resting enough during pregnancy, how was the baby... That really hurt when I'd been questioning myself so much also.

And my husband was just talking her through it all even though I had told him nobody but us in the hospital. 

I spoke up and said I wanted to be alone with my husband to rest, and he actually said that it'd just be a few minutes, they'd step out to the lounge. I didn't feel any better, I didn't want to be alone and I didn't want her possibly pushing back into the room.

Now onto the questionable part...

I should explain I grew up in a pretty abusive traumatic environment and that's given me the defense mechanism of just running when I am feeling scared or overwhelmed. It's something I'd thought I'd gotten past with therapy but I guess that moment I was feeling worse than I had in a very long time. 

I got up, kinda zoning out the pain because I felt so anxious. I got covered up with my long winter parka and pulled on my boots, and grabbed my purse and made a (slow) break for the parking garage. 

I got to my car and by the time I was there the pain had really set in, I felt dizzy and was scared of passing out if I drove, so I just laid across the backseat.

I lost track of time before a nurse found me, and at that point they brought me back inside and put me in a private area for treatment. 

It's been a month since then now and it's caused so much trouble.

I'm upset my husband didn't keep it to just us.

He says that he didn't know how serious I meant it; plus with the premature labor it was like all our plans for how my birth would go were out the window. His mother was just concerned.

He's also really bothered I left, he said it's serious destructive and I wasn't thinking about my own health or safety.

His mom has said that I seem too instable to be a mother.

AITA for walking out?So i was coming back from university when I ran into a beggar standing by the street crossing. I was having a decent day so I thought I’d help out. I had a $5 and $20 bill on me so i gave her the $5 (i am by no means financially well off) and was expecting at least a thank you. Instead she said that she saw the $20 bill and (after thanking me for the $5 bill respectfully) said that “please sir i have kids to feed i have rent to pay i have nothing”. After i told her I wasn’t well off myself, she was having none of it and things took a turn when she suddenly started cursing me for being privileged and shit. After like half a minute of hearing that, i told her “ok I’ll swap the $5 for the $20 bill”, and she agreed and gave it back to me, at which point i told her “that was greedy, I didn’t like what you did, and now I’m not giving you anything” and i took off with her screaming at me. I was on semi-fight or flight mode back there but now i calmed down a bit and i feel bad for being that harsh with her. AITA?I (42f) bought my son (13m) a smartphone. When I did (2 years ago now) we made an agreement. I would pay for the smartphone and his subscription,  but I wanted to be able to look in his phone when I wanted. This so I can supervise what is going on online. I already heard before about online bullying,  but also perverts that try to get close to a young child this way. And imo preteens still need to learn how to handle social media. He agreed to this. Yesterday he forgot his phone and i took a look. Everything was more then fine, he is polite, only talks to people he knows irl.  And when he got home I complimented him that he was so polite and well behaved. He thanked me and there was no problem so far. But then my friend told me off,  looking in your 13yo son's phone is a no go and I was a real asshole for doing it ... so tell me, AITAA little backstory:

I am a 29 yo female, was raised by a single mother (62 yo) all my life and we still share a flat because of our financial situation and because we were always really close. Growing up we never had to starve but never had enough money to go to the cinema or on vacation either. We always shared duties around the house.

When I got my first job I started paying for half of our monthly fixed costs, as my salary rose I started to pay for more and more (phone bill, internet, new household appliances, etc.) to give something back to my mother. I've been working full time (40-44 hours a week) for a couple of years now and because of her age she started reducing her hours at work and is now working only three days from 9am to 6pm. Because of that she has less money available for herself so we agreed on me paying an extra 300 EUR a month and her doing most of the shopping, cooking and cleaning around the flat, since she has more free time.

In the beginning it worked fine. The days she worked as well we would have leftovers for dinner and the days she was off work, she would do the grocery shopping and cooking in the evening. But for a couple of months now she claimes she did not have the energy to go shopping or to cook, some days I return from work and find the fridge empty so I have to leave and buy dinner if I want to eat something.

Whenever I confront her about it she gets really passive aggressive, muttering things like "maybe I should just die and leave you with all the work you never do" or "you treat me like your maid", "it can't go on like this", etc. And I agreed. Last month I told her I would do my own shopping and cooking from now on but would no longer pay her the extra 300 EUR AND I wanted us to no longer share the grocery bills. I still pay for about two thirds of rent and additional housing costs - but she has to pay for the rest and that now leaves her with very little income to spend on herself and on her hobbies.

I know she is getting old, but I always thought it was a fair deal. 

Am I an asshole for expecting her to do the shopping and cooking just because we agreed on it and no longer paying her any extra now that she can't/won't do it?My father is a very funny guy; everyone finds him hilarious and loves his jokes, but after 25+ years of it, I'm really over it. He's goofy all the time, and in recent years his personality has started changing, and the "off" switch to his goofiness has gotten to be a bit faulty. At times, he has started disregarding my wishes and acted inappropriately. We have brought these concerns to his doctors many times, but they insist it's "normal."  

I'm getting ready to defend my PhD this summer. I'm the first in my family to go to university, and my parents are incredibly excited even though they don't really understand it. They have spent the past 5 years talking about flying across the country to "watch me become a doctor." 

I only want my mother to come. My father came to 6 events that were important to me in undergrad and upset me at 3 of them. (1) He came to a presentation I was giving with a video camera. I told him I didn't want him to tape it as I was already very nervous, and he did so anyway. (2) He stood up at the end of my senior project to put a joke relating to the subject on the board in front of all my professors and other students. (3) He did me a very kind favor and drove me 5 hours to a last minute grad school visit (I was already admitted). He asked if he could sit in on a lecture, and then at the end of it, rushed to the board and did the same joke in front of the department chair who had lectured and all the students present. All three times, I knew he was going to do something, told him not to, and he did it anyway. When brought up at times after the fact, he would laugh. He still thinks the latter two were hilarious. I don't want it happening at my defense, and I don't want another thing to worry about on that day. 

I brought the idea of banning my dad up to my mother, and while she understands and will support me, she pointed out to me how many thousands of dollars he spent on my primary education, how he would work 10+ hour physical labor days while battling cancer and still come to every school performance or event that I had as a child, and how I'm their only child and this is a really harsh move. AITA for not risking it?I guess this is more of an "are my man and I assholes" question but...

We don't really want a lot of the traditional wedding registry stuff like home goods, were kind of minimalist with our home and want to keep it that way.

So we put a registry together of things we'd want for activities we do together; camping and backpacking gear, bike, and bicycle touring gear, new carry on luggage for travel, art supplies, that kind of thing. Stuff that we'd use to make memories, that's the idea. 

And a lot of our younger friends are totally onboard with it; we put plenty of affordable things and things in different price ranges on there.

But both of our families, especially some of the older people, think that our list is tacky, greedy, selfish, etc... (Even though the price ranges for most everything is lower than what each of our siblings and cousins who got married recently had...

His grandma is really annoyed we're not going to ask for home things because she thinks our house isn't homey...

AITA / are we assholes for what we asked for?Hi all. For reference, I am 29f and my husband is 30m. We’ve been together since I was 20, and got married when I was 26. When we moved in together when I was 25, we were splitting our rent evenly. I was making 65k and he was making 80k, and we live in a large US city. It didn’t really make a huge difference in my budget vs his to split rent 50/50 for 2600 a month rent.

However, things have changed. I got pregnant a few months after we go married (which we were so happy about and wanted). I didn’t want to not work, but I wanted to be home with our baby, so I found a full time remote job in my field of work. The downside is I took a cut to my salary from 65k to 50k. We continued to split rent in our apartment.

My husband, between being 26 and 30, has received a number of raises and has switched his job. He is now a senior business analyst, making roughly 195k a year. Since we were having a child, we were going to need a bigger apartment. We found a 3 bedroom for 4000k per month. He still wanted to split rent evenly, despite my protests, and despite me wanted to try to find a smaller apartment for less. In the end, I sort of let myself get walked over because he really is such a smooth talker and I do love him.

Anyway, flash forward 2.5 years, our rent has increased to 4400k. My take home pay monthly after taxes is roughly 3600k. I am paying 2.2k monthly in rent. I am also taking care of our baby and our home, doing chores, and cooking daily. My husband works from 8 - 6, but typically doesn’t get home until 7. I am burnt out. I barely have enough money per month to do things I enjoy. I feel like I am financially struggling while my husband is living a life of luxury. Yes he does take me out on dates and on vacation, but he doesn’t seem to understand that this is not enough for me.

I spoke to him two days ago very seriously, and when I asked about trying to split rent based on our income and pay an equal percentage of our income so that it is more fair than fully equal. His reaction stunned me. He asked me why having 1.6k extra a month wasn’t enough for me. I told him I’m not saving anything. He told me I should spend less on extracurricular activities - which makes me laugh because what extracurricular activities? All I do is work, cook, clean, shop for the house and raise our child. I told him I am basically working two full time jobs at once and I need help. Then he asked me if I am suggesting he pay me for being a mother and that stunned me - I really had no response to that.

Anyway, he told me that this is the lifestyle we agreed when we moved in together way back when. However, he doesn’t seem to understand, or rather does not want to understand.

Now he is mad with me because he thinks I am being selfish and has been acting cold to me these past few days. I am getting the itch to apologize and take it back like I always do, but I really feel I am right here.

Am I the asshole?

EDIT: Thank you all for all of the responses. I can honestly say I did not expect to get this feedback. 

I am honestly overwhelmed and cannot reply to all of you, especially while I am working but I wanted to update some things here.

I love my husband with all my heart, and it is heartbreaking for me to read these comments and realize that I am being taken advantage of. I need to figure out the best way to approach this issue and solve it before it gets too far. I want to work this out and the fear of being alone is haunting me.

Yes I did sign a prenup that was overseen by his family attorney. My husband comes from extreme wealth and I was young and stupid and went with it. Head over heels like my mother always said I was.

As for his family - we get along great and they love me. It’s very confusing because they are such incredibly generous people, and they are family. But they don’t know about our financial situation because my husband and I believe that our marriage is private. And I would feel like I was betraying him by telling them.

I’m sorry I cannot reply to all of you, but please know I am reading all of the comments and making of plan of approach with them.

EDIT 2: for those talking about the dates and vacations bit that he pays for - I have asked him numerous times to help lighten my financial load instead of going on these trips and dates and he has refused. He said he can do what he wants with his money and if he wants to take us on vacation that is what he will pay for. If I could afford vacation I would pay. In fact, when we were in a more even financial situation, unmarried, not kids - I paid for almost ALL of our vacations and dates because I love to treat people. And I can’t do that anymore.

EDIT 3: I also DO NOT have bad spending habits. I worked my way out of my student loan debt in two years after graduating. I saved 60k but the time we got married, and I have that all in my retirement which I am thankful for because I can no longer contribute to it. This has NOTHING to do with how I spend. I am actually pretty frugal when it comes to shopping, especially since I prefer to keep things cheap for my budget.Alrighty, so I had my son a mere 7 weeks ago and he’s very cool. Of course everyone wants to help and see him all the time.  I totally get it, he’s scrumptious. However, my MIL has been dropping some not so subtle hints that she’s upset my parents see him more than she does. 

However, she sees him AT LEAST once a week. And I always let her hold him, change him, feed him. In fact she doesn’t text me to come over but when she does, I have never said no.  It’s her first grand baby and I totally get she wants to be involved. 

It’s getting hard for me to keep quiet when she drops little bombs like “I never get to see him” “your parents always get to see him” “why do you keep him from me?” and so on. 

I do need to say that my dad is completely retired and takes his job as a grandpa seriously. He watches my niece one day a week and his whole house is baby proofed. He always has diapers, butt paste, wipes, etc... no need to even bring anything. So when I have errands or whatever I drop my kid off there because he’s home in the middle of the day. Also the other day he was running errands by my house and dropped in so I could nap (he is a saint).  It’s just little snippets of time here and there that are a huge help. 

My MIL works full time and loves her job. She always tells me I could call her and she could come help. However, my errands are always last minute and she lives a distance away. So it doesn’t really make sense when my dad is 10 minutes away and legit stops in just for an hour here and there to lend a hand. 

Her comments are getting more and more aggressive and her guilting is making me not even want to go to her house. WIBTA if I just straight up told her to suck it up, not everything is equal and because of logistics my kid is just going to see my parents more? 

P.S. I know how lucky I am to have so much help and I love my parents and MIL a lot. It’s just frustrating to feel like your disappointing someone no matter what.my daughter dyes her hair all sorts of crazy colors. i personally hate that she does that to herself, but she buys it with her own money and i can’t physically stop her, so i let it slide i guess. she just dyed her hair from pink and blue, to purple and green. except, she ran out of purple dye during the purple half of her head. she came downstairs and told me she couldn’t make it to school the next day because of her hair. i told her she did it to herself, no one would notice, and she had to go to school. she told me people definitely would notice because there’s huge chunks on her head right now still blonde, and she says since she has a new color, everyone’s gonna want to play with her hair. so she said people would definitely notice. however the next day, i sent her to school but she was crying all the way out the door. when she came back, she slammed the door, and she’s had herself locked in her room all day. i think it’s her own fault but my friends have told me i’m being too harsh and i probably just ruined some of her confidence. so reddit, AITA?About a week ago, a new friend of mine asked if she can sleep over at my place after she got kicked out by her mother. She had been staying for the night at different friends places, never more than one night. 

Scandalised by this revelation, i told her she can stay with me as long as she needs to. I had been in the exact same situation about a year ago and staying on my best friends couch for about 4 days until i got the keys to my student accommodation.

I currently live in a (university) student accommodation. My personal space consists of one small room, and the girl is currently staying on a matress. The common areas consist of a kitchen where all the other students hang out, we have shared toilets, etc. She is not a university student and in fact letting someone live with me goes against my contract. Its not the most comfortable living situation, ive never felt comfortable living here, and much less now that my personal space has been cut even more and my schedule has to take into account that i have to open the doors for this girl to come in.

Her mom already said she can go back home. The girl told me she doesnt want to, as she "is enjoying the freedom". She has not informed me until when she intends to squat in my room, and has no intention of helping me pay rent, she has made that clear during conversations we had. It appears that she intends to stay here until she gets her own place with the help of social workers, which takes weeks at the minimum and more probably some months. 

I only met her twice before this all happened. Thought she was going to be one of my new female best friends, but have since discovered that I don't like her at all or spending time with her. She is very socially awkward which often comes off as rude to my actual friends, my flatmates on the other hand like her cause shes pretty, but she is not living in their rooms. Furthermore, on the day she moved in she decided to "decorate" my room and pulled out her childhood pictures, which freaked me out immensely as even i dont have that kind of stuff in my room. 

I dont like having her here, thought it would be fun and not bother me when first talking about it as I thought it would be nice to "have a sister" to share a room with and have someone to wake me up for class, but that has not been the case as the situation actually stresses me out and i stopped liking her immediately after she moved in due to her behaviour. 


Am i the asshole as I did say previously that she could stay indefinitely and "your word should be your bond", or is she the asshole for being way too comfortable and parasitic with my little room, making me uncomfortable? I feel disrespected and am not even sure if i can explain why.TLDR at bottoms. Anon account cuz my real name is on my main account. 

My friends dad has cancer. He’s lucky in the sense that in the one and half years since he’s been diagnosed, his overall function and ability to care for himself have not been affected much. He drives himself around, recently went on a solo trip to the Grand Canyon, and along with his able-bodied wife, cleans the house and cooks dinner just fine. 

However, he recently went to the doctor to tell them that the chemo is making him unable to do anything. Which I know firsthand from the fact I live in their neighborhood, to be untrue. He was setting up a pool yesterday when I drove by and saw their yard. The doctor approved him to need a caretaker through our state. My friend applied to be said caretaker. They planned this she informed me. 

She does not live with her parents. She actually hardly visits. She says their house is “too far of a drive”. Maybe a couple times a month she sees them. She’s been bragging that she receives $2000 a month, plus full health care benefits for herself (she joined a caretakers Union). She told me she’s saving the money for a trip to Hawaii. She doesn’t need the $2000 as she already has a regular full time job, and so does her live-in boyfriend. I asked her why she is pretending to take care of her dad when he doesn’t need it, and if he does she isn’t doing it...her answer is “I mean it’s free money”. 

I find this behavior to be appalling based off how many people actually do take care of family that’s sick.
My sister thinks I’m being petty and said “I mean her dad has cancer, let her have $2000 a month.” But I see her as one of the lucky ones whose dad has cancer and isn’t too affected by his chemo. 

Would I be the petty asshole if I did an 
anonymous report to my local DHS?

tl;dr friend pretends to take care of her dad with cancer in order to receive state benefits and I’m tempted to report her for fraudJust a breakdown, I was dating my ex-boyfriend for three years. Two weeks before graduating from grad school, I found out I was pregnant even though we took every precaution. I told my boyfriend. He told me he was fine with it. He is about four years older and felt he was ready to have a baby. For about two months, he treated me like crap. Despite telling me that he wanted to keep the baby, he pressured me multiple times to terminate the pregnancy by questioning my parenting skills. He was also growing distant.I cried myself to sleep most nights. He eventually gave me an ultimatum - either keep the baby and leave him or stay with him but end the pregnancy. I decided to go with the former and moved out.After grad school, I started working as a Systems engineer so I was able to financially provide for myself. I never asked him for a penny.  

During the four months we were apart, his brother and best friend would email, text and call me to tell me to terminate the pregnancy. I also found out that he had cheated on me with an ex of his during the last 6 months of our relationship. I ended up changing my number and deactivating social media and my personal email accounts. Recently, my ex-boyfriend contacted me. He apologized for everything he did and wants to be in a relationship with me again. I have no inclination to do this. I am in a country that I have no family (my family lives in Europe). I currently have  no support system here. He made six/seven months of my pregnancy hell. He told his brother and best friend to contact me. The girl he cheated on me with sent me screenshots of their messages in which he trashed me for months. 

In the last two months or so, I reconnected with a childhood friend. He knows about my situation and we are currently in a relationship. My ex-boyfriend found out about this through a mutual friend and all of a sudden wants to be in my life. I am not okay with that. I have no problem sharing custody with him after the baby is born. If he wants to be a present dad, I won’t stop him. But I don’t want him around me for the last couple of months of my pregnancy. I don’t want him to be there with me in the delivery room. His parents and our mutual friends keep telling me to forgive him, but I can’t.The title makes this sound cliche, but here goes!

During the early months of our relationship, back when we were just casually dating and not yet exclusive, my bf was seeing this other girl. We'll call her Kelsey. 

A few weeks after we'd made it "official" and became exclusive, I came out for drinks after work with him and his colleagues. On introduction, one of his coworkers was like "Oh! You must be Kelsey!"

Nope. Certainly not my name.

So then I find out that he's been messaging her on and off over the months. That's even an over-exaggeration. Like, 1 or 2 messages over a span of 6 months. 

Enter into month 6. 

He wasn't following her on Instagram - her account is restricted - but she was following him. His account is public. I took a photo of him and posted it to his Insta account. She messaged him to say "Still hot!"

He messaged her back, saying hello and thank you and all that. 

He never told her he has a gf. And there aren't any pics of us on his Insta, so it's not like she would necessarily have picked up on the fact that he's not available. I asked him why he never told her, and he kind of skirted the issue. 

Fast forward three more months, and I find out he'd messaged her to say happy birthday. He also kept it a secret from me. I asked flat out "did you text her for her bday?" he was like, "No."

I immediately responded, "are you lying to me right now?"

"Yes," he says.

My distaste for the situation grows.

A few weeks go by, and we're at our regular couples therapy session. We go the couples therapy because I was the victim of some gnarly stuff when I was a kid (so, not couples therapy sparked by any conflict within the relationship, just a preventative measure so that may trauma doesn't impact our happiness). But I figured I'd use the opportunity to grab some sober second thought on the situation, with the BF present, so he could maybe explain some more context to help me understand why he's doing this. The therapist was like, "Dude, don't message your ex-girlfriend and lie about to your current girlfriend."

A couple of weeks later, we were having an argument on this very topic - it's still largely unresolved, and though I know he hasn't communicated with her since then, the situation is still dangling in my brain - and he asked, "What do you want me to do?"

I answered, "I want you to unfollow her on Instagram. Simple."

He won't do it. He didn't even respond.

I really don't care if he talks with his exes. I'm personally not one to be all buddy buddy with lovers past, but I know some people are and that's OK. But this one is so remarkably different to me, I just want her gone so I can feel safe and secure on the relationship.

He's travelling for work, then I'm travelling for work, and we can't get back in to see the couple's therapist until mid-April.

So in the meantime, I've gotta know:

Am I the asshole for wanting him to unfollow his ex on Instagram?My wife gave birth to our little girl about a week ago. Its been an intense and amazing experience so far, and I have been enjoying becoming a father. 

I have a friend(27M) who I(27M) have known since I was about three years old. We have been pretty close the majority of our lives.

We made plans for him to come meet my kiddo as I'm pretty darn excited to show her off to my people. When the time came to meet her, he just no showed and never reached out. The next day I remade the plans with him for about the same time and once again he no showed. After about 3 hrs after he should of been there I reached out to ask what was up. He told me he needed to go buy a bottle of booze and then he would be willing to stop by and meet her. I told him to not even bother to show up if a bottle is more important then meeting her. 

Some of my people seem to think I'm an asshole because I have known him for 24 years and I wont even entertain the idea of him meeting her until he apologizes about not only picking alcohol over my kid, but for blowing me off two days in a row.Okay so im on mobile and i just made this account because Ive been bothered by this for awhile and i dont really know what i should do. So me (22F) and my boyfriend (20M) have been together for 6 years and just had our first baby (girl) last year. 

When she was born it was very obvious my boyfriend was the father because she looks just like him, looks nothing like me. This became a joke within both of our families that she doesnt look like me. Stuff like "are you sure shes yours?" and "no need for a DNA test, BF!" All very harmless jokes and I dont mind it much because it is true. Ive told people that it does bother me a little that everyone says she doesnt look like me but its not a big deal because i dont care if she looks like me, shes her own person and shes beautiful regardless.

Anyway so this is a good time to mention im hispanic and my boyfriend is white. Well my MIL has made the same jokes as everyone else since my daughter was born, except she doesnt say my baby looks like her son, she always says that she looks like her (MIL). I have no problem with this because, again, its true. my boyfriend looks like his mom so obviously my baby kinda resembles her too.

Okay so a few months ago we all were out shopping together (me, my bf, my baby, and both my in laws) and she made a "joke" about how she can walk around the store and everyone would think its her baby because they look alike.

Okay. Thats fine, i laughed. 

Then MIL proceeds to say "since we look alike, im her mom and youre the nanny". Everyone laughs and agrees. Now, i laughed it off because i dont want to start anything but it really hurt my feelings.

Setting aside the fact that this comment was racist, (saying a hispanic woman is the nanny to her own daughter, cmon.) I feel like if i carried my baby for nine months and have been mothering her since i gave birth to her, its like a slap in the face everytime she says my baby looks like her and not me. The nanny comment solidified my feelings.

Since making that joke, she has made that joke every single time we go out with her. What makes it worse is that it seems like she is legit trying to make it seem like she is my daughters mother everytime we go out. Subtle things like if someone says my baby is cute she will say thanks before i can, etc.

Would i be an asshole if i told her i didnt like her "jokes"? I feel like if i told her my feelings everyone would be upset at me because everyone in both our families make jokes about it too. I dont want to look as though i only dislike her for something everyone does. I dont know what to do.

Edit: So i did bring this up to my bf when this happened more than once and he did agree to tell her something if it continued to make me uncomfortable but he feels that this is the same as all the regular poking fun that they do with everyone, including him. For that reason he feels telling her shes wrong will make us subject to "theyre too sensitive/cant make jokes around them" comments and not really solve the actual problem. Ive always been a passive/non confrontational person so it would be hard for me to call her out or just leave when she does it. I also think she is not intentionally being racist but she is not an ignorant person so i know she knows that it could be seen that way.

Edit 2: my MIL isnt like this all the time, shes actually a great person and we get along fairly well. This only ever happens when we go out. The jokes she makes in private are much more harmless.I interned at an office for school for 5 months and got offered a job there. I go in 2 or 3 days a week when I don't have class. I'm an office assistant, meaning I make profiles for clients, talk to insurance companies, scan papers... I'm basically the grunt worker, which is fine, cuz it gives me a lot of office experience.

Anyways, we have a receptionist (W) and a quality assurance person (H) who is also the backup receptionist for when W goes to pick up her kids from school.

The ccompany I work for has been expanding, so we're merging with a few smaller offices. I take these office's clients and upload them into our system. This isn't hard work, it just takes a long time. It was work I could have gotten done in 2 or 3 days tops and not be too backed up on scanning or calling insurance.

For the past 2 weeks, when my boss and W leave to pick up kids from school, H would always come back to where I was working and tell me to go sit at reception because she would have to pop out for a second. She would leave and not come back for the rest of the day.

Keep in mind she knew we were merging with smaller companies, and when she would come back to my office I would have stacks of papers around me, so it was obvious I was in the middle of doing a lot of work. 

The big boss (my boss's boss) came to my office the other day and said I was very behind on my work. I told her briefly what happened and that I would try to catch up. So I texted my boss and asked her to talk to my coworkers and let them know that I shouldn't be put at reception or moved from my position unless absolutely necessary. 

I walked past H in reception as I left work yesterday, she wouldn't look at me and was cold towards me.

So, am I the asshole for asking my boss to tell my coworkers that I shouldn't be doing their work?Basically, some stuff in my childhood was pretty traumatizing and involved my uncle.

I told my mom by accident in March 2018.  In summer 2019, my mom wanted to begin a civil court case and I signed for her to speak for me in court. I was grateful but a little uncomfortable with her need for vengeance. She expressed she wanted to ruin my uncle financially. This used to be my fantasy, but when I moved away for college in 2018 I finally felt peace and let it drop.  During winter 2019 she told me my uncle had agreed to start negotiating a settlement.

She started the conversation with “You have to trust me.”  ... and talked about how money can split people apart.  She told me how much money she hoped to get and how she would insure the money‘s safety and I wouldn’t have full access since I’m young and stuff.

She THEN started talking about how she wanted to use the money to buy a house in another state so she and my sister can move away for a fresh start. She made it sound like it would be an “investment”  for me to be a “homeowner” but something doesn’t sit right with me. I don’t like the idea of her taking the settlement money (an uncertain quantity) to start a new life. She kept saying “honey, I’ve never had my own house to live in, I’ve worked so hard my whole life with nothing to show for it, this house could make a difference”.  Tbh, it feels like blood money and if I receive it, I want to pay for my schooling and save the rest for when I need it. I don’t want a car/ new apartment. The money is tainted, yet I feel sickeningly entitled to it.  I hadn’t aimed to gain money from the start, but now I feel like it’s mine. I suffered for it. 

I am not against giving my parents money. I’ve been working full time since May 2019 to pay for college and support myself. The settlement would cover my tuition and pay off my parents’s loans + some nice vacations or something. 

My mom pushed to take this to civil court, it feels like this was maybe her plan all along. I feel like she’s somehow profiting from my pain and taking this as a “win” in her life.

I’m still not sure about whether my mom is capable of taking the money when it’s issued. I’m just stressed (the negotiations start next month) because she has a lot of sway over me and I’m not sure if I could deny her if it came down to it, especially since it could totally wreck our complex relationship. 

I haven’t really spoken to her about how I feel yet- I know she is not going to take it well. In addition, the actual amount of settlement might not match up with what she’s demanding and she might be getting her hopes up. I love my mom and I’m afraid my discomfort means I’m being selfish/greedy.

TL;DR

My mom wants to buy a house “for me” (that she will live in) with settlement money. the case is something she said she is doing for me, against my uncle. 

AITA for not wanting her to buy a house because I kind of feel like she is profiting off my f*cked up childhood?So I have a twin sister and I’ve always made an effort to look different from her. Ever since elementary school I’ve been dying my a hair and keeping it super short. It’s personally important to me that we look different because I would prefer to be seen as an individual than half of a pair.

We both naturally have blonde hair and she usually keeps hers long, while mine was in a pixie cut (until I recently grew it out into a bob). Occasionally she has seen a color I’ve dyed my hair and wanted to do the same color because she liked the way it looked. And although on the inside I wasn’t super excited to hear she was coloring her hair to match mine, I never told her not to do it and would say it looked great one her. 

So about a month ago a dyed my hair red and she did the same thing. I told her it looked good. Ever sense then, I’ve been wanting to change it so it will look different from hers again, so yesterday I stripped the red from my hair and went back to blonde (for the first time since junior high), cut it into a really short bob, and gave myself bangs.

My twin sister saw a picture I posted of it and messaged me asking what product I used to strip the red out. I was surprised she now wanted to loose the red hair, because she just got it less than a month ago and seemed super happy with it until now. I told her the product anyways and then she sent me a picture of her holding her (now blonde) hair up and draping some hair over her forehead to make it look like she had a short bob and bangs too (right now she has long hair and no bangs). Basically imitating the picture I posted last night to a T. And then she sent me a text saying “tbh I might just steal your whole haircut”. 

I’m feeling really unhappy about this because I just changed my hair yesterday in order for it to look different from hers. She knows that I make an effort to look different, but it kinda feels like I’m being chased around by her in circles about this. She’s also never expressed wanting a bob or bangs before this, so I’m pretty sure this idea is entirely based off of my new haircut. Would I be the asshole if I told her I would prefer if she didn’t get the exact same haircut and color as I just did?

Okay, so, long story. I am one of four kids, the second to last. My older brother, M, got married fairly young to his wife, J. They were pregnant pretty quickly after the wedding and had their first kid. In the years following they have had - wait for it - TWELVE kids since. Yes. 12. 

The kids are currently aged 14, 13, 12, 12, 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, and then the current youngest are 3 year old triplets. 

Anyway, M and J were over at our parents place, where we all get together once a month without the kids. The older grandkids usually band together and watch the younger ones, watch movies, play games, etc. 

After eating, M announced they were pregnant again, with #13. My older sister made a joke about hoping it wasn’t quadruplets this time, as she’s had a set of twins and the triplets. They laughed. 

I’d had a bit to drink at this point, and without thinking said something like “jeeze you guys are rabbits aren’t you? When do you even find the time to do it?” 

Cue the awkward glances, a little chuckle from my younger brother. M and J looked awkward. 

Eventually, older sis said something about the comment, and I just kind of kept going with it? I doubled down, and was basically like “well, I mean, how many is too many? How are you even taking care of all of them? There’s a magical thing called birth control now, you know” And looking at it now, that’s none of my business, really, but her pregnancies have been increasingly more difficult with every baby, and they ask for help with the younger ones frequently, to the point where if M is working, J will usually have at least one of the older kids at her house helping out. She’s even kept her oldest four home from school when she needed help with the triplets. 

So tell me, AITA? A lot of it is really none of my business, but like I said, how many is too many?My daughter is biracial and looks a lot more like my spouse’s side than me. So sometimes we’ve gotten some looks and generated some confusion but there’s never been any real drama before now. 

She’s 3 and we were in a store that she loves. When it was time to go, she wasn’t having it and refused to move, kept pulling away when I tried to grab her hand, crying/whining, etc. Thankfully it wasn’t a full blown, fall out tantrum but I hate being *that* parent so I wanted to get her out before it escalated. 

That’s when an employee (a woman who I would guess was in her late 40s) approached us and said “Hi, is this your child?” I said yes. My daughter wasn’t paying her much attention and still crying and pulling. That’s when the woman goes “Do you have a picture of her in your phone or wallet you can show me?” I was a little taken aback and said “excuse me??” And she said that would prove she was actually my child. 

Now, that’s when I went full on “let me speak to your manager” because I felt like this was going too far for my comfort. She looked uncomfortable and tried to keep talking but I cut her off and said again that I wanted the manager. Finally she brought him over. I explained what had happened and he apologized for the confusion. 

Ironically enough, I got one of those auto-messages that day asking me to fill out a survey on my experience at the store. Because I rated all questions as “1” (lowest score), I was the survey invited me to send a follow up email. And I ended up emailing corporate the whole story with the name that had been on the employee’s name tag and the store number. Eventually I got a follow up email. While it didn’t say the employee had been fired, per se, it did say at one point “this person is no longer employed by [store]”. So either she was fired or quit...

Also, in case it matters, I’m City Council member and do a lot of philanthropic work in my community, and that information would show up if anyone googled my name or email address. So I don’t know if that played a role in what happened with regard to what happened with the woman’s job either. 

AITA?I'm part of a tutorial group where parents sign their kids up for a year's worth of classes at a time. The payments are withdrawn monthly, but it's expected that you've signed up for the full year and probably in the contract somewhere. But we're like a family, or so I thought. Recently a kid has had to withdraw from classes for the forseeable future due to major hospitalization. When I suggested that we no longer withdraw payments from this family because they simply cannot attend, I was met with backlash because that means teachers don't get their payment for that one kid. I just cannot justify taking money from a family who has a child in the hospital, even if they did sign up for the full year, because there is no way for the kid to come back. I mean what if they died? Do we stop taking their money then? I'm so confused at how I'm supposedly the asshole because I want to take a small amount off the teacher paycheck so we don't just like... profit off a kid who's in a coma. Their concern is over where we draw the line on these "refunds", but I think the line is clearly: *hospitalized child*. It's not even my kid and I'm over here fuming. Aita?Before you put YTA for the title alone, she asked about it.

My friend who we will call Mia, is a very pretty girl. Nice complexion, medium length curly hair, hour glass figure, and fashion sense that is to die for. Obviously, she gets lots of attention from guys. 

That's not the problem though.

The problem is her indulding in their attention even when she has a boyfriend who we will call Jack. 

I don't like Jack. He's a pussy-whipped coward and tries to start shit with me anytime me and Mia argue or I don't do what she wants. Most of the time when we have our disagreements, she doesn't particularly care or gets to upset over it, but Jack will swoop in once she's out of sight and tries to get on my case.

But god damn I feel sorry for him. She will gush about other guys and flirt with other guys when he's right there as if it's not a problem. I see him die a bit on the inside every time.

Recently, she came to me and vented about how her and Jack's relationship was down in the dumps at the moment and how he said she was acting like a hoe.

I know she wanted me to profusely deny the possibility of her ever being a hoe and that Jack is delusional, but I just told her that I agreed with him. She flirted with other guys constantly, gushed about her crushes even when he was around, and it was obvious that he didn't like that.

She ended up yelling at me for calling her a hoe and that the last thing I was supposed to do as her friend was agree with her ex.

As a friend, I'm also supposed to tell you the hard truth. What she was doing, in my opinion, was hoeish behavior and if she wanted to keep a boyfriend, she needed to tone it down.

It's fine to think another guy is cute, but gushing about it when your boyfriend is there and then actually flirting with said crush is what a hoe would do. 

AITA for stating this?

*reposted because I was big dumb and made a mistake*I came home unexpectedly today. I was gonna be gone for way longer but there were a few complications and it didn’t really go as planned

I walked right in on some strange man and my mom doing it on the couch. I had never seen this guy before. My mom is single so there is nothing bigger going on but it was so weird. I freaked out and asked who the hell ge was while my mom was telling me to go away while she was getting dressed.

My mom and I had a conversation about this in my room and the dude left while we were in there. I still didn’t understand who he was and what the fuck he was doing at my place and my mom never really told me. She just told me that I’m an idiot for not letting her know about the change in my schedule and that it’s all my fault but is it really?My friend likes to plan parties.  I told him it'd be cool if he through me a birthday rager.  I told him very speficially not to throw it on a certain date as I was going to a concert.  He's expressed concerns to me before that he thinks I have a concert addiction (I average like a show a week, and 2-5 festivals a year, it's my passion) that he thinks is a reason for my lack of social life.  

He planned a party for me.  On that date.  Invited everyone I wanted to see to it.  I told him I'd show up and just leave after an hour. That day I woke up super tired and still annoyed he planned it for the day I'd been saying for weeks not to.  So I just didn't go.  I think the people who went were kinda surprised I wasn't there since it was my party, but it was apparently a fun party in and of itself so they didn't really care. The concert was an all time top 10 for me though. AITA?Fairly straightforward. Myself and my partner went to see Les Miserables last night and it was amazing. Her second time seeing it and my first, and it was my gift to her for her birthday. 

As usual with these things they’re really strict about people making noise and stuff while the performance is going on, and for 90% of it there was silence. 
Then, literally 15 mins from the end where the pivotal scene with Javert and the big emotional finale is building up, this woman behind us starts coughing. 
Not like a little tickle cough, but a proper throat clearing phlegmy cough. 

I should mention it wasn’t the spontaneous type that comes on and takes you by surprise, she coughs a couple times. Wait 35/40 seconds, coughs again and repeat for about 3/4 mins. She keeps on for a few minutes, and people are starting to get clearly annoyed. A man who I assumed was her husband offered her a drink and she said no, he also suggested she step out and she said no because she didn’t want to miss the end. 

At this point it’s getting real near the finale and she starts up again, i turn round and say 

‘Do you want a drink? Are you alright?’

It should be noted, I didn’t say this snarkily or rudely and I genuinely did have a drink to offer her, but I also probably wasn’t massively polite. I’ve not paid £95 a ticket to listen to a woman loudly cough through the finale. 

She looked at me like I’d just spat at her and under her breath clearly told me to piss off. I admit I did then say ‘shut the fuck up then’ as I turned back around. 

Performance finished, with no interruption from her coughing which had suddenly vanished. And she didn’t say anything more to me. We just walked out and left. 

AITA? My partner said I overrated and I should have ignored her?

EDIT: There was no attempt to suppress her cough, she was literally just coughing loud as you like into her hand. No attempt to be quiet etcSo my bf (m, 19) and I (f, 18) have been together for about ten months now. We were doing long distance for about six months but he just recently moved back to where I live. I’m taking a gap year before starting school but I’m a manager at the coffee shop where I work 40 hours a week. We still spend hours together every day and go on trips at least one weekend a month, but usually more (we live near the beach so it’s not hard). 
Despite this, he still wants to FaceTime me every free moment we aren’t together (if I’m driving somewhere, at the gym, etc.). I’m an ambivert and value my alone time (which I don’t have much of because I’m usually either at work or with him), so I expressed this to him and asked if we could just talk whenever we see each other.
He was very hurt and said that I didn’t spend enough time with him and that I’m always with my friends. I just recently joined an awesome friend group where I feel like I really belong, and I’ll usually hang out with them one or two nights a week at max. Am I being insensitive by asking him not to call me so much?For the content of this circumstance I will refer to the couple as Amy & Adam.

I want to set the scene for how financially stable Amy and Adam are... not because of envy... but it comes into play in a very big way. 

They are the dictionary definition of white privilege. (For context I do not work either and I'm a stay at home mom so I know what that privilege is myself...) 

Amy doesn't work & Adam has a very fun six figure job. 
They want for  nothing and greatly enjoy their success and life.

Amy cannot have children & and is a self proclaimed baby crazy lady. They already have one adopted child (who was 3 by this time) and instantly Amy decide they need another one as soon as possible. 

Amy & Adam join a private adoption agency for the 2nd adoption. This was to cut the red tape of adopting from the state. As with all adoptions you are told to be prepared, the birth mother could change her mind.

Sadly, for Amy and Adam, after the baby was born the birth mother did changed her mind and decided to keep her baby.

Per the private adoption agency's contract all the funds they spent for the failed adoption would be placed into an escrow account and applied to the next adoption of a baby that became available through the agency. They would be placed back on the wait list.

However, this wasn't acceptable for Amy. She was going to have to wait again, and Amy doesn't like to wait... Amy starts sending out messages to friends, family, and on social media because she is desperate for another baby. If anyone knew of someone thinking of placing their soon to be born child up for adoption... please ... let them know. 

Next, Amy has Adam hire a nanny so she can go take a 10 week retreat in SoCal to deal with the disappointment of the adoption falling through. 

But to Amy's delight, shortly after returning from sunny SoCal.. a young teen (just like the movie Juno) in the area is willing to let Amy adopt her baby.... however this girl is not through their private adoption agency.... therefore they will NOT be able to access the money in the private agency's escrow account. Amy and Adam will have to cover all the adoption costs themselves. 

Now, the grotesquely out of touch Amy decides to convince her husband they should create a fundraiser.
It is not enough for Amy to just post the link to her new fundraiser to her socail media page. Oh no, she private messages every single person (almost 2000) on her friends list the link. Even more ridiculous she placed the amount they were trying to raise at almost $20,000. (In truth the adoption would've been closer to $10,000).

Pleaee take into account many on Amy's friend list have experienced layoffs in the last 3 years and NONE of them are as financially as well off as Amy & Adam.

The fact Amy is oblivious enough about her friends lives and their financial troubles makes the audacity to private message those people to bankroll their adoption leave a very irked feeling behind... I basically hit a level of rage didn't know existed. 

I sent Amy a DM. (About a day or 2 after)

I suggested if she needed money to pay for the adoption perhaps she might consider selling her BMW, and look at driving a more cost effective one. Or, they could sell their 3 car garage, bonus room, private theater, 5 bedroom home and get something a little more reasonable if they couldn't afford $18,000ish to adopt another. I was trying to have her see how ridiculously crazy when you live their lifestyle to make a fundraiser! Basically, their fundraiser was like going to a food bank for groceries when their bank account was full.

Amy was livid. She said the fundraiser was due to so many of their friends desperate to help after the other adoption fell through. (We meant dinners, helping to raise their spirits not by writing checks). Also.. Amy belongs to one of the mega churches that preaches God rewards you with prosperity and it was this church's friends who were fanning the flames of the fundraiser.

 Amy admitted when I DM'd her about the fundraiser that they were NOT in actual need of money. (And we all knew that because they put in an offer on a new home less than a week before she made the fundraiser).

She was livid because she couldn't believe I would suggest instead hitting up their friends for money they don't really need instead curbing their spending on luxury items. 
Why would you do a fundraiser when you put in an offer on a new home?

I'm all for adoption and I was adopted myself but you don't get to use an adoption to fund an over the top lifestyle. Fundraisers are for people truly in need are they not?

 Her fundraiser closed with less than a thousand donated. 

So. Am I The Asshole?My MIL has struggled with her weight for years, and I feel bad for her, but recently she started a new diet. It’s been working, but almost all her diets have worked, she just gains the weight right back because none of them are sustainable.

I, on the other hand, have never been on a diet. I eat pretty decent and I take my dog for a walk at least every other day, usually more. I’m not like perfectly in shape by any means, but I’m healthy and happy with the way I look.

For the past month that my MIL had been on this diet she has been pressuring me to join her. She can’t have any sugar (which, I’m not sure how because 80% of food has sugar in it) or carbs. Only lean meats, veggies and fruits 2-3 times a week. First of all, I’m vegetarian. If I went on this diet all I would eat is plain vegetables and I would get a nutrient deficiency in a split second. Second, my favorite thing is ketchup. I’ll put it on near everything. What brought this exact argument is me putting ketchup onto a pan of fried tofu and my MIL going “when you join my diet you won’t be able to have ketchup, you know” and I told her that it was a good thing I wasn’t joining then, because I would hate to give up ketchup. And she says “well, when you’re 47 years old and 50 lbs overweight, you’ll change your mind” and I said “well then I’ll just have to be more conscious of my food choices so I don’t get overweight” she says “too late”. I finally snapped and said that just because she doesn’t have any control over herself doesn’t mean that I don’t, and that just because she is overweight, unhappy and forcing herself to be on a diet doesn’t mean that I’m in the same boat.

She stormed out and came back a while later with her husband (my husbands step dad) and one of her sons. It ended with a fight between them and me, my husband, and my BIL and SIL, who had also been dealing with her comments about the diet.

I feel like an ass because I know she struggles and I can probably take the comments, but god damnit it was getting annoying as hell and I just couldn’t help myself. AITA?

Edit: if this is important, I’m 5’4 and 135 lbs so it’s not like she’s actually trying to be helpful because I’m not that heavy.

Edit: GO AWAY WITH ALL THE UNSOLICITED DIET ADVICE! This is an asshole sub, not a diet sub. My doctors thinks I’m at a perfect weight and that I shouldn’t lose or gain any, so I don’t want any randos advice on how to lose weight that I shouldn’t be losing. Also, my husband walks the dog on the days I don’t. She’s fine. Stop worrying about her.So I have custody of my niece  (8f) this year because her father is deployed. Her parents, my sister and her father are going through a divorce. They had been living separately and co parenting for about 6 months before deployment. So super fresh change for my niece. She was already having a difficult time adjusting before he left. This is his first deployment since the family dynamic has changed. 

Now I normally have my nieces summers so she can spend time with my son (7m) as we live in a different state. I also take her most breaks, I have a lot of flexibility with my job and can adjust my schedule for breaks. So her and I are close. 2 weeks before she was supposed to go back home my sister sprung on her and me that should would be staying for the school year. No biggie on my part  if you have 1 kid you can have 20. But it did put me  in a tailspin trying to get her registered for school and in an aftercare program. I’m an adult and I know how to adjust and adapt, but my niece was devastated. Rightly so as her life was / is already in a tailspin. She has always been your typical spoiled only child, but her behavior took a dive. She has become mean girl. She’s constantly bullying / belittling my son. She’s cruel to the point that it’s concerning. I understand her behavior and know it’s because she’s having a difficult time with all that’s going on her life. While I understand it, I don’t condone it. So I’m constantly reprimanding her, but I always talk to her and tell her that I understand that’s she’s upset but she can’t take it out in her cousin, my son. 

Flash forward to last weekend it was a holiday weekend where I’m from. So I had my nephew (9m) over for the weekend. I’m in the kitchen super busy trying to cook and straightening up when I can hear her bullying and being cruel to my nephew at the table. My son was also at the table 20 questioning me as only a 7yo can. So I’m busy and distracted. I chime in to tell her to cut it out and be nice. I asked why is she acting like this and she says so you’ll send me home. Once again I’m not really focused because my son is going a mile a minute with his questions, I’m trying to load the dishwasher and not burn dinner. I blurted out without thinking “I would never throw you away, you’re family and I love you”.  I noticed her go quiet and I felt more than saw a change in her body language.  

It was like a switch went off in her little head. Her behavior drastically changed overnight for the better and I overheard her tell one of friends that’s she going to live with me forever. 

Now I’m racked with guilt thinking I may have accidentally implied that,  that’s  what her mother did. It’s really not what I meant. I always tell her and my son nothing they do changes my love for them, even when they’re being bad or annoying. So I just wasn’t thinking when I made that remark. 

Be gentle, AITA?

Edit 1: Fixed some grammatical errors. 

Edit 2: I'm being vague about my sister as her and I are currently not on speaking terms. We got into a fight right before she told me that my niece needed to stay with me. We're not doing a good job of hiding it too. That also added to my guilt. I really wasn't trying to shade her mother. 

Edit 3: Her mother is currently dating a man with 3 kids under the age of 5 and every time they video chat she is with one or all of the kids. So I may have subconsciously been thinking that my sister threw her away like a comment mentioned. That may be the main reason why it slipped out of my mouth like that. It was literally said between saying the ninja turtles can't live in Chicago because it's too cold, no you can't have a soda, help set the table and my inappropriate comment.So for context my(26m) sister (32) has always been really judgmental, when I use to have friends over for sleepovers or just to hang out at my house she would make comments like talking about their looks and if they liked stuff she would say it dumb and just be a mood killer. but I could never say much as she would just bombard me with more comments so I let it slide.

Anyway I was visiting home from my city were I work with my wife who was a bit chubby but nothing to really talk about as it wasn't all to visible with clothing on. So we were in the driveway pulling up when I see my sister. I greeted her and the family and she immediately starts by straight up laughing at my wife when she seen her, I told her to knock it off and said "you're sensitive and you're fat" followed by laughing. I let it slide as I didn't want an argument in front of my family.

Later on we were eating dinner and my wife was eating peacefully when my sister said "you should definitely take some food off your plate your already full of food" and my wife just sighed. After dinner my wife took a pack of crisps and started eating them in the living room. My sister just talked and commented nasty things to her and the last one I remember was "you should stop eating being a pig and be more like me". And I just became angry and said "you mean a woman in her thirties without a partner for more then a year living with her parents and commenting on others?... exactly so shut the hell up and just watch TV". She started to tear up and just said I was a fu*n asshole and to get out of her life and she stormed off.

I was told by my wife and parents I went to far and that's just how she is. I dont know if I was an asshole so tell me, am I the asshole reddit?My boyfriend and I have been together for 2.5 years. Most of the time, I'm willing to cuddle with him but if I decline he doesn't get it at all. Earlier, I was trying to sleep and he started cuddling me. His body gets very hot and it's uncomfortable for me. I also feel suffocated and cuddling just isn't an enjoyable experience for me. However, I know he enjoys it so I will gladly cuddle with him after sex. I have no problem with hugs or kisses. It's just the idea of two hot bodies smashed together in a bed. His arm is usually wrapped around my stomach. I just feel like I can't breathe. This time, I declined and said I don't feel like cuddling. He responded by saying "that's not fair." I explained that I was just trying to sleep and his body felt really hot. He left the room and said he had to get ready, until I said "ok fine" and we cuddled for a bit. I just don't like his immediate reaction of "that's not fair." AITA?My son is 5, he is type 1 diabetic so he has a compromised immune system.

I have full custody but he does see and talk to his dad sometimes. 

His aunt (dad's sister) is getting married tomorrow. His dad's brother has lived in Vietnam the last 3 years. He's a teacher... his school and community there are all currently shut down b/c of the coronavirus. 

Brother flew in yesterday for the sister's wedding tomorrow. On his flight he had a 2 hour layover in Japan. Then had layover at LAX where a flight attendant was just diagnosed and CA is under state of emergency. 

There's no way for me to know if he has been or could be tested. I'm worried he could be asymptomatic. I'm worried because their entire family has been exposed to him and they're going to want to hug and kiss and touch my son. 

I'm also supposed to do the bride and bridesmaids makeup and my kid is the ring bearer. but at this point I really don't want to go in fear of the virus.. So, AITA if I don't go to this wedding in fear of coronavirus?

TL;DR: my kid is 5,  type 1 diabetes. supposed to go to a wedding tomorrow with relatives from Vietnam; AITA if we don't go?Woman screams at me for using the handicapped stall for literally 30 seconds

I used to go to the mall occasionally on my lunch from work to kill time especially since it is winter in Canada and outside is -30 some days. This was before Christmas but not peak hours of mall traffic (like 1240 on a week day). 

There is a large ladies room at the mall I go to but from what I recall only a couple handicapped stalls. The rule I assumed everyone follows is that obviously if someone is visibly in need of that washroom they get it ahead of any line or anyone, no question. However, if there is no one matching that description the stall is up for grabs as an available toilet. 

There was a huge line up for the washroom when my mother and I went to use them. I saw the handicapped washroom was available because some other able-bodied person was leaving it.  I hurried in because otherwise I would have pissed myself. (Note: I did not cut the line. I had waited to get to the front of the long line. That is why I had to pee so badly.)

Not even 10 seconds after I shut the stall door and sit down to finish my business I hear someone shout, “Fucking bullshit!” I wasn’t sure it was aimed at me until I heard the three bangs on the outside of the stall and saw the front of a wheelchair being pulled in. 

I could not stop what had begun in that stall but luckily it took less than a minute to complete. You can ask my coworkers. I say I’m going to the washroom and they don’t even miss me. I am the fastest pee-er imaginable. 

I open the door to an elderly woman who is being wheeled by who I can assume is her daughter based on similarity in appearance and pissy facial expression. 

“For fucks sake! It’s not for you!” is what the old woman screams at me before my eyes widen and I walk to the sink in shock unresponsive. 

“There were no other bathrooms,” I manage as the daughter rolls her eyes and stands guard outside the stall while her mom is in there. 

So am I the asshole for doing as my body dictated? Are bathrooms like parking spots or do my rules make sense?My 17 year old sister passed away fairly recently, and she was cremated. She was very hard-working and not a huge spender. She had about $5400 saved up and my mother wants to give it away as a sort of scholarship to students in our area. I appreciate my mother's reasoning behind this and I think it's sweet. However, I don't know if it's what my sister would've wanted.

When my sister was alive, she loved my grandparents' home in Morocco and often expressed that she wanted to move and live the rest of her life there.

When I heard my mother talking about her "scholarship", I brought up how much my sister loved Morocco. My idea was that we could use the money to take a trip to visit our family, share stories/remember her, and spread her ashes there. I think she would've liked it. She immediately told me to shut up and to mind my own business. I understand that she's grieving and I'm just a kid but it felt cruel ~~and I don't know how my sister would've felt knowing that her mother was giving away her savings to someone who hadn't done anything to earn it. I know there are problems with the "pull yourself up by your bootstraps" idea, but my sister subscribed to this mentality. She worked her ass off at her job and wrote essays and applied to a ton of scholarships because she knows that my family can't afford to pay for her college.~~

Also, I don't see why we couldn't do both. Use the money to take the trip, and then give the rest away.

Edit: Forgot to mention that I'm 15.

Edit 2: I don't know why I brought up the bootstrap crap. My sister would've liked the scholarship I'm sure. I think I just want to be with family and feel understood and I tried to justify it but honestly there's no good reason for my sister's money to be what pays for it.So I work in a pretty small and open showroom. There are only 6 people that work in this showroom with me and we each have very open desk areas that can be walked through and around. (They are kitchen displays with desk space). Two of the people in the office are fairly new (hired 2 months ago). Although I am the lead designer here, I sit at the “front desk” which is the most open and everyone seems to help themselves to my office supplies. I wasn’t bothered by it at first but I am pretty OCD about my many pens and about germs at my desk. I had noticed that people were taking my nice pens and not returning them which bothered me a good amount. I decided to put my things inside of my desk drawer and I set out a community pen cup for anyone to use or take what they need. They now frequently open my desk drawers (that I’m literally in front of most of the time) without asking and they use my rulers, hole punch, tape etc. I’m to the point where this is just pissing me off now because everybody has their own things but for some reason still use mine. I also let my coworker use my charger once and now he goes into my drawer any time he wants and takes it. I don’t like people rummaging through my drawers because I see everyone cough into their hands and not wash them. I have nicely pointed this out to a few of them and they know how I feel about germs but they say “sorry when I was a kid they taught us to cough into our hands.” This may not seem like a big deal but I really don’t want people touching my shit and I feel like I will sound like an asshole if I tell them they can’t anymore. BTW I am 20F and work with all older men (44 up to 70).So, a little background. My dad was in a marriage beforehand with a woman that already had a kid. This marriage didn't last long, but he still cared for that daughter like she was his own, and she is apart of our family. Anyways, she is in her late 20's and has 4 kids. 2 are usually at their dad's, while the last 2 aren't.

 My sister is going to watch the littler child while I watch the toddler. My usual babysitting price is 12 dollars an hour, but I decided to give her a deal and go down 2 dollars an hour, so 10 an hour. Well, she's wanting me to watch her from the evening to the morning the next day, roughly 12 hours or so. I brought up the price to my mom, dad, and sister and they said that I was entitled and got all over me for wanting to charge 120 for the whole thing (Not looking at how I was charging 10 dollars instead of 12 an hour). They said "They'll be asleep for a good chunk of it" which is a bit true, but these kids are kind of rambunctious and don't go to sleep until 10 or 11. I'm also going to have to wake up and make them breakfast and all, though. They just keep telling me that I should charge a flat rate because they'll be asleep for a good chunk of it. What do you guys think, am I the asshole for wanting my older sister to pay 10 dollars an hour?I (23 y/o F) currently work full-time as a nanny on the East Coast. The family has one young child. The father (38 y/o M) has been following the coronavirus pandemic pretty closely. Because we live in a highly populated area, the father has decided the family is to retreat to their house in the Midwest to ride out the major waves telling me I'm coming with. This was decided on Wednesday and the plan is to leave on Saturday, giving only 3 days notice. They also want me to live with them in case of a quarantine, but this will drastically change the dynamic as I am currently not a live-in nanny. They also want me to keep their child within a few block vicinity of their Midwest home. The family is very kind and amazing bosses, but I have no friends or family in the Midwest and a life where we currently all reside. AITA for not wanting to drop my entire life for my job? Also any advice will be taken for trying to get out of the job.Backstory: one of my uni classmates cheated on an exam recently - we're not talking one or two questions, but literally the whole thing (the method was pretty unique, so for the sake of anonymity I'm not going to get into details). He said the class/exam was a waste of his time, so he couldn't understand why he should study for it. This in itself wouldn't bother me too much, but the outstanding grade he received led to him being nominated for a very prestigious scholarship by the prof who teaches said class. It's not just a lot of money, but also looks very good on paper and only a few people get nominated for it every year.

I myself did not take the class, but my best friend who did told be about this - apparently he didn't even try to hide that he was going to cheat and even told other people in the class about it. He also boasted about how he got nominated for the scholarship afterwards and how he felt that he deserved it, which annoyed most of us way more than him getting nominated in the first place. This led to a few students including myself considering to give the professor in question an anonymous tip so he might reconsider the nomination. WIBTA if I informed the prof about the situation? 

Some more info: The prof doesn't pay much attention during exams (he's usually grading other assignments or smth) which is what makes this kind of behavior possible. Also, this isn't the first time that said student cheated on an exam. As far as I know, he isn't in any kind of financial trouble and doesn't need the money more than any other student.My best friend and I have different opinions on many things, things that I feel very passionate about like climate change, women’s rights, etc I am very left leaning while she is more right leaning. Normally we can just agree to disagree but the other day she voiced that there should be a ‘white history month’ since there is a black history month. 

We had a heated argument and I left her house. After thinking about it for days I messaged her saying I was having trouble wrapping my head around the thought that there should be a white history month and that’s a very problematic view point to have. She doubled down on it and wouldn’t listen to me. I ended up basically telling her I could no longer be friends with her because I would feel like a hypocrite, I can not condone her thinking and I think she is completely wrong.

I am now wondering if I have over reacted, I know not everyone shares my views, am I wrong to end a very close, long lasting friendship over this?Throwaway because he knows my account.

Me [F 27] and my fiance [M 28] have been together a little over two years. In the time I've know him he would always share his dislike for children. He can't stand being stuck in the same room as them and anytime someone asks his opinion of having his own he always says he never wants any as it would ruin his life. I've never had a strong opinion one way or the other. I'd prefer to never have kids as well but if it happened I could make it work. Because I love him and want to be with him I accept the fact I'll never have any, and that's fine.

The problem is our only form of prevention is birth control pills, we rarely use condoms (sometimes I just like being a twinkie instead of a toaster strudel) I've been on the pill for 10 years with no problems as I'm very diligent with taking them. I have a timer on my phone and have never missed a pill that I can remember. But I know shit happens and it's not 100% effective. This is why I brought up to my fiance he should get a vasectomy if he truly never wants children. The first time he just kind of laughed and said that was a bit extreme. I told him if I ever did get pregnant I'd most likely want an abortion but I don't know how I'd feel unless it happened.

Throughout the last year everytime he brings up his hate for babies I bring up him getting a vasectomy. He's starting to get annoyed with me but I hate that all the  responsibility is on me to prevent an accident. I know it's his body and his choice but if it's something he thinks will ruin his life I want to protect him from that.

AITA for bringing this up so frequently?So some context, I recently graduated with a CS degree and was the first member of my family to attend university. While I was doing my undergrad both my grandparents passed away leaving their house to my father and his sister which was sold for around $1.4 million. When this happened I still had a couple of years left of my undergrad and was assured by the rest of my family that some of that money would be for my student loans. When I graduated I moved back in with my parents temporarily and he told me he didn't want to pay them off until I started working full time. (I wasn't happy but I didn't complain) I was able to request a delay on my loan payments to give me some time to find employment. Fast forward to now. I have found employment and he told me to make sure I "save some of my paycheck for when my loan payments start up".

I don't know how to approach this. I know a lot of people have student debt and in the end it's my own responsibility. When I enrolled in university I had the expectation I would be paying them off myself but when he recieved the money I felt a huge burden off my shoulders and thought he would help me out. 

Also I even approached him with the idea of him paying off and me paying him back so I could avoid the interest but he said he doesn't want to do that because what if I "can't make a payment."

And yes I have talked to him about it before and he always avoided giving me a straight answer. "Let's talk about that when you graduate" "Let's talk about that when you get a job"

EDIT: I'm not sure if this changes anything but my debt is approximately $35,000. I'm not sure what the average debt is for an undergrad but from my understanding it can be a lot more than that.Backstory: I was in an abusive relationship and my aunt A and my mother M said they would help me out of it and let me live with either of them if I moved to their state to live with them. I did and my aunt tricked me into signing myself off the lease when she “just wants to live alone.” The same thing had happened to my mother even though we are both tidy people who stay to themselves and always pay the rent on time.

I am now homeless again. I asked my mom to help me as I’ve only lived here a few months and have no one else up here who can help me. My mother said I have 14 days to get an apartment with my $9.25 an hour 30-35 hours a week job. Cut to 4 days in (today) and she says I need to find a place by tomorrow because my problems are causing her blood pressure problems. I asked her what I should do since she was homeless in this town for 3 years before finding her place and she said I’m an asshole for putting this on her and “it’s all about you, isn’t it?” It’s not like I haven’t been looking for a place, making phone calls to homeless shelters, and posting ads on multiple websites looking for a roommate or a place to rent. I just figured that the people who offered me help hundreds of miles away wouldn’t leave me up creek without a paddle. I’m just dumbfounded that a mother would be okay with her daughter being literally on the streets tomorrow.My boyfriend has a buddy that works on the mines and the buddy wants bf out there to work. Boyfriend needed a resume but had no idea how to make one so I helped out upon request. 

I have experience writing resumes, I’ve even had a few people try to pay me for them because they look professionally done.

So I was working on his resume. I made two mistakes, I said he could lift up to 200lbs (because he has lifted me with ease before and that’s how much I weigh :( ) and that he has his GED. Technically the 200 lbs wasn’t a mistake, but he didn’t want it in there. Anyway....

He looked it over and started going bullistic, saying it was all just bullshit (it was all factual information. He didn’t need any embellishments) and then called me the “r” word when I put that he had his GED instead of grade 12. I hadn’t even finished writing it yet so obviously first drafts are supposed to have errors.

He went on to say that it was dumb and that he could do a better job, that at least when he talks he doesn’t sound like he’s spewing bullshit. I tried telling him, it’s a first draft, it’s not a big deal, it’s all things that can be fixed. I reminded him that I’ve done resumes before, and in fact, I did his father’s last week. He told me to stop “up selling” myself and that the only reason his dad asked was because he doesn’t know how to use computers (his dad owns and uses a laptop). 

So I said, “Fine. You want to be mean?” And then I deleted everything and told him to do it himself. 

Now he’s calling me petty and an asshole. Personally I don’t think he should get help if he’s going to be mean to the person that’s helping him so I don’t think I’m an asshole. But maybe everyone sucks.


Edit: I already know that this isn’t a healthy relationship, and I appreciate all of your concerns. I am, and have been, working on an exit strategy for a long time. Unfortunately living is expensive and if I leave now, I would be homeless with two cats.I (22m) have recently started dating a girl (20f) and it isn't too serious yet, but we get along incredibly well and have a great connection. I can honestly see us being a long term possibly if things continue as they are.

I have a friend (22m) who is a little awkward and as long as I have known him, he has been single. However, when I introduced him to my girlfriend, I was surprised to find that they knew each other...they had hooked up via tinder several months ago, a sex only arrangement. To be clear, this does not bother me - whatever she did before we began dating is not my business. She assured me later that she has no romantic feelings for my friend, and I trust her.

What makes me uncomfortable is my friend. Since then, we've all hung out together a few times (a large group of 7-8 people) and there have been a few times where he has made pointedly sexual comments and jokes towards her. Sometimes just jokes about her being attractive, comments about her body. He also made a joke that I "stole her from him" and that I'm being somehow overly possessive or out of line for "not letting her sleep with other guys". Nobody laughs when he says this shit. My girlfriend has a very loose sense of humor, so she's not super offended by it, but she does agree that it's uncomfortable for him to be talking about, especially in mixed company.

AITA for not wanting to invite him around anymore? I don't really care if my girlfriend still hangs out with him, but I don't want to deal with it anymore, frankly.So there's currently a blizzard outside, and I waited 45 minutes for my bus.  The roads are horrible, and the snowplows haven't gotten to all the main streets yet.  When it finally arrived, and I got on, I noticed that there was a guy smoking a cigarette INSIDE THE BUS, as well as drinking vodka? or something else obviously alcoholic from a bottle.

I said, (in a pretty angry tone, but I didn't raise my voice or yell or anything) "Can you please put that out?  You can't smoke in here."

He just stared at me, and mumbled something like "Says who?"  And then he started snickering.

I asked him again, "Please put that out.  You can't smoke in here."

He continued to laugh, so I went up to the bus driver and told her someone was smoking and drinking in the back.  She was incredibly annoyed (I hope at the guy and not at me) and said over the PA "I cannot continue the route while there is someone smoking and drinking from an open container!"

She stops the bus for a minute, there's some shuffling in the back, and then she starts the bus up again.  Except now we're stuck.  For a good ten minutes.  Now half the bus starts glaring at me.  And I literally hear "snitch" from several people.

Look, I didn't know that stopping the bus would cause it to get stuck.  In any case, I'm not the one who was SMOKING INSIDE A BUS.  The open bottle of vodka I could deal with.  But I'm not about to tolerate cigarette smoke inside.As a child I was raised by my grandparents and was somewhat spoiled, though I never realized everything going on around me. My grandfather was an alcoholic and my grandmother was a drug addict. I saw my biological mom only a handful of times as a child, more as I got older. She was addicted to methamphetamines and cocaine. At around twelve I decided to go live with my father and his new wife alongside my two twin biological sisters.

We've moved houses a few times and I try to keep contact with her to a minimum because of how self destructive she is. One of my sisters loves our mother and thinks of her as the perfect person, the other sister is more like me and doesn't want much to do with her. My dad and step-mom are also on my side about this. Well, a little over a month ago she started constantly calling my phone. She's done this sporadically for a while now and it's annoying. My mother does nothing for me, she doesn't send us child care money, doesn't visit. Only calls when she needs something to benefit her.

On the chain of calls she leaves voicemails calling me "rude and inconsiderate of her situation." It made me feel terrible and I just need to know if I am truly in the wrong here as she has made my heart hurt with these voicemails and texts.

Am I the asshole here for not responding and ignoring her?

EDIT: She is still on these drugs and hasn't really let off them at all.My sister has a 9 year old son ,who I will call J. He has a terrible attitude, and my sister has a very bad habit of dropping J off at my doorstep for me to babysit him without any notice whatsoever.

She did this again this weekend, probably because she was going out with her friends. I heard the doorbell ring, and by the time I got to the door, J was standing there and my sister drove away. So I let him in.

After a while, I noticed that the wallet that was sitting by the bedside table was missing. I asked J if he knew where it went, to which he smugly replied "You can't prove that I stole the wallet!", which means he obviously stole it. I told him that he needs to hand it over immediately, and he continued to be smug about it. So I called my sister and told her to come pick him up. She refused, and said that I need to deal with him myself.

I have had many prior incidents with J, so this was my last straw. I told him that if he doesn't hand it over, I will call the police. He thought I was kidding, so I just went ahead and called them. He apparently still believed that I was kidding even after I called them, because he only started freaking out when the cops pulled into the driveway. At this point, J was sobbing uncontrollably. He handed over my wallet, and started begging me for forgiveness. I told him that he'll have to wait for the cops to come in.

When the cops came in, I explained the situation to them. I told them that he stole my wallet which I got back, and that his mom needs to come pick him up and that she refuses to do so. I asked them to take J until his mom comes, so they handcuffed him, put him in the back seat of the cop car, and called my sister to come pick him up. They were very gentle with him, and he was not hurt.

About 20 minutes later, my sister showed up. She started crying and screaming at me, and was acting so erratically that the cops had to tell her to behave herself and threatened to arrest her. Eventually, my sister took J and drove home.

She cried to all of our family members about it, and I have been receiving many angry messages from them. I have gone NC with my sister, and thankfully I don't think she'll be dropping J off at my house any longer.

I feel that I was justified because I never agreed to babysit J, my sister refused to pick him up, and there was nothing I could do apart from putting my hands on him and digging through his pockets, which I won't do.My brother (24m) has been living with me (27f) for a few months. 

I let him move in because he lost his job working construction under the table. As a result he had no way to pay rent, and was evicted from his old apartment. 

It was supposed to be temporary. 

He is my baby brother, and was emotionally abused by our step mom after our biological mother died. I have always tried to take care of him, and realize I’m actually just enabling him. 

After almost a month of waiting for him to find a job, I gave him two weeks. He sat on his ass until the last day of the deadline. Then was hired on the spot at a pizza place.

I have been paying for his food and not receiving any rent. I’m a college student who can barely pay my own way. Let alone support someone else who is barely making an effort. 

On top of all this, my brothers room already smells awful, and no matter how many times I tell him food isn’t allowed in his room, there are always plates and pizza boxes, etc. the other day there were 20+ beer cans strewn about too. 

He is so dirty that he has actually contracted ringworm. I had to get him the ointment for it because I knew he wouldn’t on his own. 

I’m basically his mom since he has moved it. I have to tell him to clean, do laundry, even SHOWER. 

I don’t have the energy to keep nagging him. But if I don’t, he won’t do anything. 

I want him to find his own place. I have tried to talk to him about moving out, but lost my nerve. 

My land lord offered me an out yesterday. He said he would tell my brother his rental application he just submitted was denied and he had 30 days to find another place to live. He told me that the only reason he would allow my brother to stay would be as a favor to me anyway, since his application was extremely questionable. 

Will I be the asshole if I take him up on it?
